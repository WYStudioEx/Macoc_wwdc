			<description><![CDATA[
				<p>Minor changes to get the app ready ahead of next week's event.</p>
				<p>Apple has just released their official Developer app for macOS, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-developer/id640199958">check it out in the App Store</a>.</p>

				<h2>From the previous release:</h2>
				
				<h3>Welcome to WWDC for macOS version 7!</h3>

				<p>This update has lots of fixes and improvements, as well as some cool new features.</p>

				<ul>
					<li>The app's UI has been modernized to look better in macOS Catalina, with new fonts and colors</li>
					<li>The video player has also received a UI refresh to improve the contrast between controls and the background</li>
					<li>Transcripts are now provided by Apple, which means they're the same as the ones in the Apple Developer app, including support for multiple languages</li>
					<li>You can now search within a specific session's transcript</li>
					<li>The transcript can now be detached into its own window, so you can rearrange your workspace with more flexibility, such as putting the video and transcript side-by-side in fullscreen</li>
					<li>Meet the new Community tab: in partnership with CocoaHub, we're bringing you curated content from the community, including Apple announcements, blog posts, podcast episodes, conference videos, and more</li>
					<li>Clip Sharing: if you've ever wanted to share a specific segment of a video with someone, you now can! With a downloaded video selected, just click the scissors button and select a portion of the video to share</li>
				</ul>

				<p><strong>NOTE: starting with this version, the app requires macOS Catalina (10.15) or later</strong></p>

				</ul>

			<description><![CDATA[
				<h2>This version contains some bugfixes so you can have a great experience during this WWDC week.<br>
				Below are the full release notes for 6.0, in case you missed them:</h2>

				<h3>WWDC 6.0 release notes</h3>
				<h3>This is a major update of the app with some great new features and improvements:</h3>

				<h4>iCloud Sync (beta)</h4>
				<p>That's right! You can now sync your favorites, bookmarks and progress in videos between multiple computers. All you need is to be logged in to your iCloud account.</p>

				<h4>Related Sessions</h4>
				<p>When watching a specific session, we will show related sessions to you so you can binge watch and expand your learning.</p>

				<h4>Session Links</h4>
				<p>Some special events and labs require you to make an appointment, some special events have links for directions. We now show those important links at the bottom of the session details so you can schedule an appointment or find directions right from the app.</p>

				<h4>"Now Playing" integration and Bluetooth control</h4>
				<p>Playback in the app will now show in the "Now Playing" Notification Center widget. This also means you can control playback using your AirPods (or any other Bluetooth headphone).</p>

				<h4>Touch Bar support</h4>
				<p>The player now shows its controls in the Touch Bar so you can easily control playback anywhere in the app without moving your mouse.</p>

				<h4>Calendar integration</h4>
				<p>If you see a session in the schedule you'd really like to attend, just click the calendar button in the session details and an event will be added to your calendar. Remember you can still ask Siri to remind you about a session when you have it selected in the app!</p>

				<h4>State restoration improvements</h4>
				<p>You can quit the app without worrying about losing your place. Everything will be back where you left off when you launch it again, including search and filters.</p>

				<h4>Improved Chromecast support</h4>
				<p>We have updated Chromecast support to be even better and more stable, enjoy watching the keynote on your big screen.</p>

				<h2>Happy WWDC 2018! 🎉</h2>
				<h3>This is a major update of the app with some great new features and improvements:</h3>
				
				<h4>iCloud Sync (beta)</h4>
				<p>That's right! You can now sync your favorites, bookmarks and progress in videos between multiple computers. All you need is to be logged in to your iCloud account.</p>

				<h4>Related Sessions</h4>
				<p>When watching a specific session, we will show related sessions to you so you can binge watch and expand your learning.</p>

				<h4>Session Links</h4>
				<p>Some special events and labs require you to make an appointment, some special events have links for directions. We now show those important links at the bottom of the session details so you can schedule an appointment or find directions right from the app.</p>

				<h4>"Now Playing" integration and Bluetooth control</h4>
				<p>Playback in the app will now show in the "Now Playing" Notification Center widget. This also means you can control playback using your AirPods (or any other Bluetooth headphone).</p>

				<h4>Touch Bar support</h4>
				<p>The player now shows its controls in the Touch Bar so you can easily control playback anywhere in the app without moving your mouse.</p>

				<h4>Calendar integration</h4>
				<p>If you see a session in the schedule you'd really like to attend, just click the calendar button in the session details and an event will be added to your calendar. Remember you can still ask Siri to remind you about a session when you have it selected in the app!</p>

				<h4>State restoration improvements</h4>
				<p>You can quit the app without worrying about losing your place. Everything will be back where you left off when you launch it again, including search and filters.</p>

				<h4>Improved Chromecast support</h4>
				<p>We have updated Chromecast support to be even better and more stable, enjoy watching the keynote on your big screen.</p>
