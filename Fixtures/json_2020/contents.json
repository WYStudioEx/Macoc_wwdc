While Chris still thinks, creates, and works visually in his mind, his blind persona continually fascinates him with surprising “outsights” — special insights about architecture, technology, and the world around him gained as a result of losing his sight. Join Chris as he shares his newly-found vision and the positive impact his experience has had, and hear his challenge to all to realize a truly smart world through universal inclusive design.",

Learn about the new semantic segmentation mattes available to you from both AVCapture and Core Image to isolate a person's hair, skin, and teeth. Using any of these individual mattes or combining all of them, your app can now offer a tremendous amount of photo editing control.",

In this session, we'll explore new additions to the framework that allow you to achieve great performance in your filter chains and custom CIKernels. We'll also demo a new approach to prototyping in Core Image through the use of an interactive Python environment. Through these techniques you'll discover new ideas for building new creative effects as well as practical approaches to batch processing images for tasks such as image compositing and data boosting for machine learning.",

His journey led him to build Avaz, a wheelchair-mounted tablet to help people with disabilities communicate, then even more ambitiously, to invent FreeSpeech, an entirely new visual language that could break down language barriers altogether. Ajit will talk about the series of events that led to the creation of the Avaz and FreeSpeech apps, their impact in India and around the world (earning him the National Award for Empowerment of People with Disabilities from the President of India) and his ideas on the transformative role that apps can play in education.",
