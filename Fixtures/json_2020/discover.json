The accident left Nijhuis paralyzed from the neck down. He was 26 years old.\n\n“I couldn’t move anything except for my head, and only had an eighth of my normal breathing capacity. There was almost no hope of healing or repairing the spinal cord,” says Nijhuis, a professional graphic designer and photographer. “At first I was questioning if I wanted to continue life like this.”\n\nDavid Niemeijer, a friend of Nijhuis’ since childhood, remembers that dark time well. “His new physical challenges drained the life right out of him.”"},{"id":"4F590601-B02D-4E20-A6A8-A3DF0618AAE2","type":"image","image":{"id":"6EF977AD-5A23-495C-BDAB-F8929292E72E","caption":"Giesbert Nijhuis (top) inspired his friend David Niemeijer to create AssistiveWare.","isPlaceholder":false,"showsCaption":true,"aspectRatio":0.7305785123966942}},{"id":"2851F18F-676A-4CBD-8355-4A2B7F191919","type":"text","text":"The accident affected every part of Nijhuis’ life, including his very livelihood. To edit images on his Mac, he needed to be able to enter key combinations, but the assistive onscreen keyboards available then didn’t allow for that. In his new situation—or his “second life,” as he likes to call it—he was facing serious accessibility issues. \n\nSo Niemeijer, who has a degree in agricultural and environmental sciences and was working at a university at the time, created his own assistive keyboard—what would become the Mac app *Keystrokes*. He soon scaled back his work at the university to focus on founding a software company, AssistiveWare, which released a number of pioneering accessibility tools for the desktop.\n\nAnd then came the launch of iOS, which changed everything for Niemeijer by untethering assistive software from the computer. In 2009, just a year after the iOS Software Development Kit launched, AssistiveWare released its breakthrough product: *Proloquo2Go*."},{"id":"D34D5098-9237-474E-A178-CE951F5E8E60","type":"image","image":{"id":"89685241-78D2-4F01-828E-A2C994CBCBD5","caption":"*Proloquo2Go* is a symbol-based keyboard to aid people with difficulties in speaking.","isPlaceholder":false,"showsCaption":true,"aspectRatio":1.3928571428571428}},{"id":"FC3237FE-416E-4CDA-B687-9E678757F299","type":"text","text":"*Proloquo2Go* gives a voice to those who have difficulty speaking (proloquo is Latin for “to speak out loud”). Paired with an iPhone or iPad, it also made this assistive technology more widely available. “It enables people to start learning to use it much earlier. It used to be that you’d get an expensive machine when you were 7 or 8 years old,” says Niemeijer.\n\n“With an iPad or iPod touch, you can start around 2 or 3 years old, which makes a huge difference, because some kids then can go to regular schools and are not reliant on special education.” \n\n*Proloquo2Go* presents a variety of simple drawings; tap them to create sentences that the app will read aloud. Instead of providing only a limited number of predetermined sentences and phrases, *Proloquo2Go* lets you combine words in infinite ways."},{"id":"F22870A2-1079-4B97-8CC9-C1DF40082DCD","type":"text","text":"“It offers users total communication,” says Niemeijer. “It allows people to not just use utilitarian language, such as asking or answering questions, but also to share stories or emotional anecdotes. It allows them to tell a joke.”\n\nAssistiveWare currently has a half dozen apps available across iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch. *Pictello* lets users create storybooks using text-to-speech and the photos on their iOS device. *Keeble* is a highly customizable keyboard app that supports users with motor challenges, low vision, and dyslexia. And *News-2-You* publishes a weekly newspaper, written with both text and symbols, for beginning readers. \n\nNijhuis is proud of what Niemeijer has managed to build. “I love having seen David’s works grow from the software he made just for me to the company it is today, serving so many people all over the world.” \n\nThe designer continues to influence AssistiveWare’s evolution: He created the company logo and the app icon for *Proloquo2Go*."},{"id":"6B1D2C84-BA70-45D4-97BE-ACDCBB0ED6D1","type":"separator"},{"id":"74579312-CFF6-425F-80E7-623264D343C3","type":"text","text":"*Originally published on the App Store.*"}]}},"shareURL":"https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=15u3zxkk","permalinkKey":"15u3zxkk","webDisplaySetting":"summaryDetail"},{"id":"D4526E5C-1E7A-4EBE-9C4F-759D090E4195","datePosted":"2020-05-21T10:00:09-07:00","expirationDate":"2025-05-21T10:33:49-07:00","localizations":{"eng":{"id":"66B124D1-1671-429B-8D43-A370293744E7","summaryComponents":[{"id":"D5B26C90-99B4-4EB5-959F-F81B21FEDAFA","type":"category","category":{"lightColor":"#F98E3C","darkColor":"#F19D2F","englishText":"","text":"Design"}},{"id":"67C4FCF8-C9F5-4832-8396-315BC2E261A4","type":"image","image":{"id":"890D50EB-A43A-4C1A-8FF2-0919A9ADC3E9","caption":"The Breathe app on Apple Watch with VoiceOver on and the minutes element selected","isPlaceholder":false,"showsCaption":false,"aspectRatio":1.7777777777777777}},{"id":"2F5798CE-96B7-4C0F-938F-3E537E9841EC","type":"title","title":"How to design an accessible Apple Watch app"},{"id":"7633176E-477B-497B-9D01-DA7119D039BA","type":"date","date":"2020-05-21T22:01:27Z"},{"id":"A6CD780D-7017-493A-80B1-A0E64BDF25D9","type":"text","text":"Apple Watch is built with accessibility in mind, empowering everyone to use their device in the way that suits them best — and your Apple Watch app can take advantage of all these features to create a seamless experience that’s both inclusive and accessible."},{"id":"FFB4F127-38B5-48BA-91C4-B2EC1FB082E2","type":"detailLink","detailLink":{"text":"Learn more","articleID":"D4526E5C-1E7A-4EBE-9C4F-759D090E4195"}}],"detailComponents":[{"id":"545AFA00-DC06-4F76-BB5D-39C1B13E5E85","type":"category","category":{"lightColor":"#F98E3C","darkColor":"#F19D2F","englishText":"Design","text":"Design"}},{"id":"EDA8D54C-1F51-4FA8-9B43-B416600D198E","type":"image","image":{"id":"890D50EB-A43A-4C1A-8FF2-0919A9ADC3E9","caption":"The Breathe app on Apple Watch with VoiceOver on and the minutes element selected","isPlaceholder":false,"showsCaption":false,"aspectRatio":1.7777777777777777}},{"id":"D392B441-49E3-4667-AA8B-7C4A27B4A7C6","type":"title","title":"How to design an accessible Apple Watch app"},{"id":"4CBCCCCE-AA63-47D9-BFAF-2BC3F2F6A8F7","type":"date","date":"2020-05-21T22:02:51Z"},{"id":"5CE3C7D5-76AF-4B2B-8C1F-0C86F8BE00F5","type":"text","text":"Apple Watch is built with accessibility in mind, empowering everyone to use their device in the way that suits them best — and your Apple Watch app can take advantage of all these features to create a seamless and inclusive experience.\n\nWhen you’re designing your Apple Watch app, here are a few considerations to take into account to make it accessible to everyone."},{"id":"7EF301B2-AF07-4EBF-84FB-9C9FC6AE0AA1","type":"header","header":"Responsive, responsible reviews"},{"id":"A1D14632-7F06-45AD-85DC-0CD1B600B3D6","type":"text","text":"One of the best ways to get a picture of the work you need to do is to explore Apple Watch’s accessibility and display options: These allow people to adjust or augment their interface and interactions with Apple Watch.

You can also use localized [SF system symbols](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/sf-symbols/overview/) and set the directionality for custom symbols — for example, for right-to-left languages like Arabic and Hebrew."},{"id":"00226A1D-E3F0-4380-8077-DCDAC2710865","type":"image","image":{"id":"43D041DE-3FAB-4C0E-BCE7-D21E5C8E03DF","caption":"An Xcode screen displaying localized assets","isPlaceholder":false,"showsCaption":false,"aspectRatio":1.7777777777777777}},{"id":"CE85C503-6CA8-4D05-B267-DF06D6B80958","type":"text","text":"Use Apple APIs to correctly express user-visible or dynamically-generated values, such as dates, lengths, weights, prices, and currency symbols, across different locales.

Whether they’re switching from app to app, bringing together apps on iPad using Slide Over or Split View, or creating multiple windows of the same app, they should be able to pick up right where they left off — and UI state restoration is a core part of making that experience seamless.\n\nWhen your app goes out of view, the app’s process is typically put on pause; it’s not given any more CPU time, which keeps the processor free for other tasks. If your app has background processes that are running, the system can even terminate those if an active app needs more resources than currently available.\n\nRestoring the state of your UI is a crucial part of making your app feel responsive — and it’s especially important if you plan to support multiple windows in your iPadOS app. If you have a note-taking app that has four different notes open in different Split View pairings, for example, state restoration helps preserve each note, rather than returning someone to the main screen when they open one of the windows."},{"id":"CDFB818C-B660-4DE6-86A2-D073B2D23131","type":"image","image":{"id":"AD4008A5-831B-4D78-9AA9-1D8059D4BB33","caption":"Two different types of scenes can be backgrounded and processes halted.

(For more information on working with scenes in your app, check out the [Developer Library](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/app_and_environment/scenes).) Here’s how to get started with scene-based state restoration: \n\n1. Create a `NSUserActivity` object to save the app's state. This can be created in your scene delegate.\n2. In this `NSUserActivity`, store relevant information (like the current navigation’s state, and view controllers that have been presented or pushed) along with your user’s intent.\n3. Return this `NSUserActivity` within `stateRestorationActivity(for:)` in the scene delegate."},{"id":"BCA7316E-FCFF-4EFB-8D2D-189B39B95464","type":"image","image":{"id":"C4E81D37-61B8-4384-ADF9-B825B1AA59E2","caption":"You need to collect the right information in each UIScene to pick up where someone left off.","isPlaceholder":true,"showsCaption":true,"aspectRatio":1.7777777777777777}},{"id":"225027F8-7B38-48C8-817E-0E7E183D1CC8","type":"text","text":"This `NSUserActivity` will now be stored inside the scene’s `stateRestorationActivity` property. When your app needs to restore its state, it should do so by looking for this saved `NSUserActivity` under `scene(_:willConnectTo:options:)` in the scene delegate.\n\n\n**What about the older view controller-based state restoration APIs?** \n\nIf you need to support older versions of iOS, macOS, or tvOS, you can use older view controller-based APIs for state restoration via restoration classes and the app delegate. This also means if you want to update your app to adopt UIScene as well as implement UI state restoration across multiple versions of iOS, you will need to implement both scene-based and view-controller based APIs. However, we highly recommend building scene-based UI state restoration.\n\nCompared to the older APIs, modern state restoration requires a different approach to how you define, save, and restore your UI state and your user’s intent. With a scene-based app, you have to separate events in an application’s life cycle and the scene’s life cycle, which means tracking changes also differs. Having multiple scenes means there are many more windows to track, each with unique user actions and navigation history. For some of those windows, you may choose not to restore state depending on their function, requiring state restoration to be more flexible and dependent on how you define the user’s intent."},{"id":"0F2C2DB5-AE7E-4E9A-A32C-E8E69A8C1F88","type":"image","image":{"id":"4AA05114-11D2-4E36-B59C-EC89461A6763","caption":"Prior to the introduction of UIScene, each app had a singular life cycle.","isPlaceholder":true,"showsCaption":true,"aspectRatio":1.7777777777777777}},{"id":"9F1825F1-FF46-4C18-AC10-1A87F278B4E7","type":"text","text":"If you can update your app to scene-based restoration and take advantage of `NSUserActivity`, you’ll also unlock easier pathways to implementing features like Spotlight search, Handoff, enabling Universal Links, and creating new scenes as primary or auxiliary windows.

a scene delegate for CPTemplateApplicationSceneSessionRoleApplication. This can be done dynamically in your UIApplicationDelegate by returning a configuration in application:configurationForConnectingSceneSession:options:, or ahead of time in your app's Info.plist in the Application Scene Manifest. \n\nThe delegate must conform to CPTemplateApplicationSceneDelegate, where it will be given an instance of CPInterfaceController and CPWindow, as you've been used to with CPApplicationDelegate.\n\nAdditionally, to support CPTemplateApplicationDashboardScene, include a new key in your Application Scene Manifest to declare support for CarPlay Dashboard: CPSupportsDashboardNavigationScene with a value of true.\n\n**Step 2: Define the dashboard delegate**\n\nNext define your delegate to the dashboard scene just like you would for the main template application scene. This delegate conforms to CPTemplateApplicationDashboardSceneDelegate and will be given an instance of CPDashboardController and UIWindow. \n\n**Step 3: Draw your CarPlay Dashboard content**\n\nUse the provided window to draw navigation related content for display in the CarPlay Dashboard, similar to the CPWindow given to the main template application scene. You can also provide two instances of CPDashboardButton to CPDashboardController that appear in the guidance card widget while your app is not actively navigating.\n\n**Step 4: Use your app in CarPlay Dashboard**\n\nPeople can interact with your app through both the dashboard buttons as well as within your main app interface. When navigation begins in your app using CPMapTemplate and CPNavigationSession, CarPlay will automatically display maneuvers in the guidance widget. When navigation ends, it will revert to your currently set dashboard buttons."},{"id":"C28577AC-DB1C-4724-8D9A-FC983EA6CC6D","type":"separator"},{"id":"B203FBBE-EEAC-42F2-93F2-4B67B033B761","type":"header","header":"Resources"},{"id":"E03B4AB9-C74D-4FD5-87D6-E847D54C47DD","type":"text","text":"[Learn more about creating apps for CarPlay](http://developer.apple.com/carplay)\n\n[Learn more about integrating CarPlay with your navigation app in the Developer Library](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/carplay/integrating_carplay_with_your_navigation_app)"}]}},"shareURL":"https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=tsmnvknj","permalinkKey":"tsmnvknj","webDisplaySetting":"summaryDetail"},{"id":"2A04FD17-F862-4885-A8E0-4C9BBBDE2B1F","datePosted":"2020-04-07T10:00:20-07:00","expirationDate":"2021-04-07T14:37:42-07:00","localizations":{"eng":{"id":"D9CF6A12-0E59-4E78-908B-D3589CD44CEE","summaryComponents":[{"id":"9F72EF1C-E7EE-4605-B7B9-56586AD1EC0A","type":"category","category":{"lightColor":"#3782D3","darkColor":"#48A0FF","englishText":"Develop","text":"Develop"}},{"id":"2EAD1CA9-8B53-4259-ACC8-FA869E581068","type":"image","image":{"id":"CEC8500F-ADFE-48A9-A424-A2DDD130609C","caption":"Two iPhone screenshots of SFSafariViewController in the developer app and WKWebView in the Washington Post app","isPlaceholder":false,"showsCaption":false,"aspectRatio":1.7777777777777777}},{"id":"CD2B9080-C18B-4561-9459-40D04C241FF9","type":"title","title":"Should I use WKWebView or SFSafariViewController for web views in my app?"},{"id":"F1C02A10-1049-4374-A916-4F40AA0CA094","type":"date","date":"2020-04-07T21:35:33Z"},{"id":"13763E3F-ED52-4695-8F3A-D27F862C314D","type":"text","text":"Whether your app needs to provide a full web browsing experience, display richly-styled content, or incorporate external websites without taking people out of your app, you can make the experience smooth and seamless by choosing the right API."},{"id":"2CFBA309-B2DD-476A-88B6-CDA838BA93D7","type":"detailLink","detailLink":{"text":"Learn more","articleID":"2A04FD17-F862-4885-A8E0-4C9BBBDE2B1F"}}],"detailComponents":[{"id":"8C770A07-8FA6-45E1-8EC2-D5203DC56838","type":"category","category":{"lightColor":"#3782D3","darkColor":"#48A0FF","englishText":"Develop","text":"Develop"}},{"id":"22F57E25-E6EE-48B6-A330-F96351597B4D","type":"image","image":{"id":"CEC8500F-ADFE-48A9-A424-A2DDD130609C","caption":" Two iPhone screenshots of SFSafariViewController in the developer app and WKWebView in the Washington Post app","isPlaceholder":false,"showsCaption":false,"aspectRatio":1.7777777777777777}},{"id":"DDB50563-CC9C-4560-81AD-0ABCFE6779D7","type":"title","title":"Should I use WKWebView or SFSafariViewController for web views in my app?"},{"id":"08C087FF-5B38-4AAF-8D5E-088E7EEA4EAF","type":"date","date":"2020-04-07T21:35:43Z"},{"id":"8DFA7B6D-2543-4282-B54C-97B4D74E9C43","type":"text","text":"Whether your app needs to provide a full web browsing experience, display richly-styled content, or incorporate external websites without taking people out of your app, you can make the experience smooth and seamless by choosing the right API.\n\nYou can display web content inside of your app with both the WKWebView and SFSafariViewController APIs.

Learn more [here](https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=12232019b).*\n\n**WKWebView** is part of the WebKit framework: It allows you to embed web content into your app as a seamless part of your app’s UI. You can present a full or partial view of web content directly in your app by loading a view that leverages existing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript content or create your own if your layout and styling requirements are better satisfied by using web technologies.\n\u2028**SFSafariViewController** is part of the SafariServices framework, and lets your users browse a web page, or a website right inside your app. With it, people can enjoy the same web browsing experience they get in Safari — including features like Password Autofill, Reader, and Secure Browsing — without ever having to leave your app.\n\nThese two APIs can provide a lot of the heavy lifting for web technologies in your app, though there are a few instances where we recommend alternative frameworks. For example, when presenting a web-based login screen for your app, use ASWebAuthenticationSession to provide people with the most secure experience."},{"id":"2FFC0C81-B6ED-4E35-84B0-43BD6D08EF9D","type":"header","header":"When should I use WKWebView?"},{"id":"0E73110F-E869-4686-AF38-52B2583969B4","type":"text","text":"If you need to customize or control the display of web content — or interact with the content itself — WKWebView will be most flexible in helping you build the implementation that suits your needs.

So that’s what I did, and word started to spread pretty fast online. \n\nI had mentioned that if anyone wanted a copy on disk, they could mail a floppy and a self-addressed return envelope to me at my home. I was inundated with floppies.\n\n**BBEdit has been around for a lifetime by software standards. How have you seen the user base change?**\n\nOur base started as Mac software developers, scientists, system administrators, and other technical users. The first big change was popularity among HTML authors and web back-end developers. As word spread, we were able to help folks understand that the internet was built with text—that you could treat text as data or you could treat it as a document. So the next wave brought in internet architects, cryptanalysts, and scientists from unexpected disciplines.\n\nThe third wave has been mostly writers and other content creators—folks who see their text not as data but as words, and who want as little as possible between them and their words.\n\nHowever, as many changes as we’ve seen, there has been a delightful constancy to our customers: They’re people who simply want to get work done. They’re not distracted by shiny things in their software tools. \n\n**What are some of the more surprising projects you’ve seen people create with BBEdit?**\n\nThere’s been so much! Our customers have used BBEdit to create novels, doctoral theses, and other long written works. One customer has used BBEdit as part of the development workflow to fly UAVs [unmanned aerial vehicles] the size of an F-16; the flight control system sends data to BBEdit in real time, where the engineers examine it, change it, and send it back to the aircraft in just a few seconds. And the Human Genome Project even uses BBEdit to help analyze long sequences of DNA."},{"id":"7E445B0B-2681-49BF-9A59-F9BD4EA6FDF6","type":"image","image":{"id":"C3DDA113-1489-486E-AF99-0657F57C7B2B","caption":"Version 3.0 of BBEdit, “accelerated for Power Macintosh,” from 1994.","isPlaceholder":true,"showsCaption":true,"aspectRatio":1.3333333333333333}},{"id":"BABF809F-87B0-4214-B68E-FC3A4C2E1A95","type":"text","text":"**How has the software evolved over the years?**\n\nBBEdit has undergone one huge technical transformation after another. First there was the port to PowerPC. We developed an OpenDoc component, and some of the internal architecture work we did for that is still in use.\n\nThen came a nearly complete rewrite of its internal architecture, followed closely by a port to Mac OS X—BBEdit was the first third-party application to run natively on that new OS—and then the port to Intel. Last year we finished rewriting BBEdit again, this time as an AppKit application. \n\nIn between PowerPC and OpenDoc, there was another development: the emergence of the World Wide Web. BBEdit had a plug-in model at the time, and two of our customers—one in the UK and one in Spain—independently wrote HTML markup tools. This was 1995, and we had no idea what HTML was, but we could tell that it was going somewhere. So we evaluated the tools, chose a set of them to bundle with BBEdit, and off we went. Little did we know...\n\n**BBEdit is one of the most beloved apps out there. Why do you think that is?**\n\nWe’ve always had the utmost respect for the user. Every internal decision about look and function answers the questions “What does the customer need?” and “How can we help them be more productive?” (Not “How can we give them what they’re asking for?” because that isn’t the right question to answer.)

Now more than ever that commitment takes on special significance as the world fights the COVID-19 pandemic. Communities around the world are depending on apps to be credible news sources — helping users understand the latest health innovations, find out where they can get help if needed or provide assistance to their neighbors.\n\nTo help fulfill these expectations, we're evaluating apps critically to ensure data sources are reputable and that developers presenting these apps are from recognized entities such as government organizations, health-focused NGOs, companies deeply credentialed in health issues, and medical or educational institutions. Only developers from one of these recognized entities should submit an app related to COVID-19. Entertainment or game apps with COVID-19 as their theme will not be allowed.\n\nWe understand the need to get these apps into the hands of customers as soon as possible. We encourage developers that meet this criteria to select “Time-Sensitive Event” on the expedite request form to ensure prioritized review since App Store review may take longer.\n\nIf you are developing an app on behalf of a client, please advise your client to add you to the development team of their Apple Developer account. If your client does not yet have an Apple Developer account, they can enroll in the [Apple Developer Program](https://developer.apple.com/programs/). Nonprofit organizations, accredited educational institutions, and government entities that plan to distribute only free apps on the App Store can request to have their annual membership fee waived, if based in an eligible country."},{"id":"213CB99E-D1DC-4A7D-BD5D-C47B5E0A34D6","type":"header","header":"Resources "},{"id":"D9D3BF68-307B-473B-95DB-21156B847488","type":"text","text":"[Learn about membership fee waivers](https://developer.apple.com/support/membership-fee-waiver/)\n\n[Read the App Store Review Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/)\n\n[Request an expedited review](https://developer.apple.com/contact/app-store/?topic=expedite)"}]}},"shareURL":"https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=03142020a","ogSocialImageURL":"/news/images/app-store-og.png","ogTwitterImageURL":"/news/images/app-store-og-twitter.png","tileImageURL":"/assets/elements/icons/app-store/app-store-128x128_2x.png","tileImageWidth":128,"tileImageHeight":128,"permalinkKey":"03142020a","webDisplaySetting":"summaryDetail"},{"id":"54F2BE76-302B-466E-84B0-024707992B6F","datePosted":"2020-03-13T09:00:18-07:00","expirationDate":"2021-03-13T22:58:45-08:00","localizations":{"eng":{"id":"E00911AB-FBB0-44F3-8482-8DD2748CB99C","summaryComponents":[{"id":"3A53F129-7B17-45EB-A89B-220ECD7CDA62","type":"category","category":{"lightColor":"#E54035","darkColor":"#FA4F44","englishText":"News and Updates","text":"News and Updates"}},{"id":"124001DC-AB0F-4B6C-8BF3-D32F86F5DF57","type":"image","image":{"id":"B002DF94-FD09-45A7-A2D8-94B1C3E6D940","caption":"Apple logo on aluminum background with hello sticker, WWDC sticker, 2020 sticker","isPlaceholder":true,"showsCaption":false,"aspectRatio":1.9047619047619047}},{"id":"07A877DA-A9B3-4AC1-8D6C-2C45B6A74794","type":"title","title":"WWDC20.

If your existing app requires more time to implement the guidelines, we’ve provided an additional six months, until March 3, 2020, to bring it into compliance."},{"id":"AAB7CEFE-4A9C-40CB-8818-B8632404DABB","type":"resource","resource":410}]}},"shareURL":"https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=09062019b","ogSocialImageURL":"/news/images/app-store-og.png","ogTwitterImageURL":"/news/images/app-store-og-twitter.png","tileImageURL":"/assets/elements/icons/html5/html5.svg","tileImageWidth":128,"tileImageHeight":128,"permalinkKey":"09062019b","webDisplaySetting":"summaryDetail"},{"id":"0EE67713-5CFC-4171-82ED-BBA74214DFD7","datePosted":"2019-09-03T14:00:00-07:00","expirationDate":"2020-09-03T14:00:00-07:00","localizations":{"eng":{"id":"31FECA57-061D-42E7-A221-CC8A5188D71D","summaryComponents":[{"id":"1ACC325F-8BB8-4FD8-BE3B-A1E786BA224C","type":"category","category":{"lightColor":"#E54035","darkColor":"#FA4F44","englishText":"News and Updates","text":"News and Updates"}},{"id":"66442EA8-F98B-4679-82B7-51AE7246F8A7","type":"title","title":"Notarizing Your Mac Software for {macOS Catalina}"},{"id":"F2525152-AF2E-46E0-ACE8-3A626B8BAF2E","type":"date","date":"2019-09-03T21:00:00Z"},{"id":"E9B9E570-E4C8-42AE-9780-5AE2F23DFFE6","type":"text","text":"As a reminder, Mac software distributed outside the {Mac App Store} must be notarized by Apple in order to run on {macOS Catalina.} To make this transition easier and to protect users on {macOS Catalina} who continue to use older versions of software, we’ve adjusted the notarization prerequisites until January 2020."},{"id":"B8781664-94A2-46A4-A707-C5D9CAD5460B","type":"detailLink","detailLink":{"text":"Read More","articleID":"0EE67713-5CFC-4171-82ED-BBA74214DFD7"}}],"detailComponents":[{"id":"4E1A6729-0473-4636-A459-926DFC79783F","type":"title","title":"Notarizing Your Mac Software for {macOS Catalina}"},{"id":"F26FEFBF-DEC0-4100-8956-E81B182B670C","type":"date","date":"2019-09-03T21:00:00Z"},{"id":"8FC696E3-D17C-49AB-BF27-B5A78B01717E","type":"text","text":"As a reminder, Mac software distributed outside the {Mac App Store} must be notarized by Apple in order to run on {macOS Catalina.} To make this transition easier and to protect users on {macOS Catalina} who continue to use older versions of software, we’ve adjusted the notarization prerequisites until January 2020.\n\nYou can now notarize Mac software that:\n\n- Doesn’t have the Hardened Runtime capability enabled.\n- Has components not signed with your Developer ID.\n- Doesn’t include a secure timestamp with your code-signing signature.\n- Was built with an older SDK.\n- Includes the com.apple.security.get-task-allow entitlement with the value set to any variation of true.\n\nMake sure to submit all versions of your software.

In order to continue providing a safe experience for users and a great opportunity for developers to be successful, we sometimes need to update the App Store Review Guidelines.\n\nPlease note these summaries of the latest changes and see the App Store Review Guidelines for full details. All guidelines are now enforced for new and existing apps, unless otherwise indicated.\n\n- **Guidelines 1.3 and 5.1.4.** In order to help keep kids’ data private, apps in the kids category and apps intended for kids cannot include third-party advertising or analytics software and may not transmit data to third parties. This guideline is now enforced for new apps. Existing apps must follow this guideline by September 3, 2019. \n- **Guideline 4.7.** HTML5 games distributed in apps may not provide access to real money gaming, lotteries, or charitable donations, and may not support digital commerce. This functionality is only appropriate for code that’s embedded in the binary and can be reviewed by Apple. This guideline is now enforced for new apps. Existing apps must follow this guideline by September 3, 2019. \n- **Guideline 5.4.** Because VPN provides access to sensitive data, VPN apps may not sell, use, or disclose to third parties any data for any purpose, and must commit to this in their privacy policy. Certain types of apps — such as those for parental control, content blocking, and security — from approved providers may use the NEVPNManager API.\n- **Guideline 5.5. (New)** Because MDM provides access to sensitive data, MDM apps must request the mobile device management capability, and may only be offered by commercial enterprises, such as business organizations, educational institutions, or government agencies, and, in limited cases, companies utilizing MDM for parental controls. MDM apps may not sell, use, or disclose to third parties any data for any purpose, and must commit to this in their privacy policy.\n- **Guideline 5.1.3(i).** Apps may use a user’s health or fitness data to provide a benefit directly to that user, such as a reduced insurance premium, if the app is submitted by the entity providing the benefit and the data is not shared with a third party. The developer must also disclose to the user the specific health data collected from the device. \n- **Guideline 5.1.1(viii) (New).** Apps that compile information from any source that is not directly from the user or without the user’s explicit consent, even public databases, are not permitted on the App Store.\n- **Guideline 5.1.1(ii).** Apps must get consent for data collection, even if the data is considered anonymous at the time of or immediately following collection.\n- **Guideline 1.1.3.** Apps may not facilitate purchase of ammunition.\n- **Guideline 4.2.7.** Remote desktop clients now include game consoles owned by the user. Software appearing in the client must be fully executed on the host device.\n\nDemo videos of app functionality that is geo-locked or otherwise restricted are not accepted. Developers must provide a fully functional app for review.\n\nSign in with Apple will be available for beta testing this summer. It will be required as an option for users in apps that support third-party sign-in when it is commercially available later this year.\n\n{[Read App Store Review Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/)}"}]}},"shareURL":"https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=06032019j","ogSocialImageURL":"/news/images/app-store-og.png","ogTwitterImageURL":"/news/images/app-store-og-twitter.png","tileImageURL":"/assets/elements/icons/app-store/app-store-128x128_2x.png","tileImageWidth":128,"tileImageHeight":128,"permalinkKey":"06032019j","webDisplaySetting":"summaryDetail"},{"id":"C86454F7-A565-47C1-80D8-1E583DA38A5D","datePosted":"2019-06-03T12:00:00-07:00","expirationDate":"2020-06-03T12:00:00-07:00","localizations":{"eng":{"id":"77F7767B-6500-49B2-803F-2A9B87D41F96","summaryComponents":[{"id":"D6DC3DFF-B3E5-4873-A6B6-E55A9E01026B","type":"category","category":{"lightColor":"#E54035","darkColor":"#FA4F44","englishText":"News and Updates","text":"News and Updates"}},{"id":"96440AFF-DCD7-4B25-9426-67E22C93CC5B","type":"title","title":"Notarization Requirement for Mac Software"},{"id":"282FC2BD-A26D-4ECD-AB27-EC313342A858","type":"date","date":"2019-06-03T19:00:00Z"},{"id":"E15BAD56-402C-4FA5-98E0-31FC84F2C425","type":"text","text":"Mac apps, installer packages, and kernel extensions that are signed with Developer ID must also be notarized by Apple in order to run on {macOS Catalina.} This will help give users more confidence that the software they download and run, no matter where they get it from, is not malware by showing a more streamlined Gatekeeper interface."},{"id":"06C00DE1-898E-4809-B603-3F9B7086243F","type":"detailLink","detailLink":{"text":"Read More","articleID":"C86454F7-A565-47C1-80D8-1E583DA38A5D"}}],"detailComponents":[{"id":"AD0F4080-784D-4134-8442-F473A8850376","type":"title","title":"Notarization Requirement for Mac Software"},{"id":"B4C6D605-B1B3-4357-81EF-931E50BD87C6","type":"date","date":"2019-06-03T19:00:00Z"},{"id":"6D2F97C4-100E-4409-AB28-36492086E2D6","type":"text","text":"Mac apps, installer packages, and kernel extensions that are signed with Developer ID must also be notarized by Apple in order to run on {macOS Catalina.} This will help give users more confidence that the software they download and run, no matter where they get it from, is not malware by showing a more streamlined Gatekeeper interface.\n\n[Learn more](https://developer.apple.com/developer-id/)"}]}},"shareURL":"https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=06032019i","ogSocialImageURL":"/news/images/og/mac-10-15-og.png","ogTwitterImageURL":"/news/images/og/mac-10-15-og-twitter.png","tileImageURL":"/assets/elements/icons/macos-catalina/macos-catalina-128x128_2x.png","tileImageWidth":128,"tileImageHeight":128,"permalinkKey":"06032019i","webDisplaySetting":"summaryDetail"},{"id":"5AA68D22-963A-45ED-A00A-D09243B75417","datePosted":"2019-06-03T12:00:00-07:00","expirationDate":"2020-06-03T12:00:00-07:00","localizations":{"eng":{"id":"9841FE3D-C613-4557-A4A7-63274B59F9EF","summaryComponents":[{"id":"40526A66-403C-4ECD-BC9F-124772E889BD","type":"category","category":{"lightColor":"#E54035","darkColor":"#FA4F44","englishText":"News and Updates","text":"News and Updates"}},{"id":"89E055D3-230F-4915-BA8A-CB6010140234","type":"title","title":"Feedback Assistant"},{"id":"9684C130-E176-4395-BFEB-178BA70129F0","type":"date","date":"2019-06-03T19:00:00Z"},{"id":"43D3A19E-299C-412F-9FC3-1D9FE75835BC","type":"text","text":"You can now submit developer feedback and file bug reports to Apple using the native Feedback Assistant app for iOS and Mac, which features automatic on-device diagnostics, remote bug filing, more detailed bug forms, and more bug statuses.
