"],[8,"Please welcome Vice President of "],[10,"Software Sebastien Marineau-Mes.\n\n"],[24,"Good afternoon, everyone, and "],[25,"welcome to WWDC. "],[28,"Did we love the morning keynote? "],[32,"There you go.\n\n"],[34,"Now this year is one of our "],[36,"biggest for developers and we're "],[38,"really excited to show you what "],[39,"we've been working on and see "],[40,"what you think. "],[42,"This morning's keynote was just "],[44,"a taste of what's happening this "],[45,"year. "],[46,"There is so much more that we "],[47,"want to share, and this "],[49,"afternoon we're going to focus "],[50,"on the areas that matter most to "],[51,"you as developers. "],[53,"Are you ready to hear more? "],[56,"There we go.\n\n"],[58,"Now we've taken a huge step in "],[59,"terms of developer experience "],[61,"this year with the new SwiftUI "],[63,"framework as well as great "],[65,"interactive tools in Xcode.\n\n"],[68,"And we've really seen each of "],[69,"our platforms get even deeper at "],[71,"what they do best. "],[73,"We have powerful new pro "],[74,"capabilities for Mac, and new "],[76,"Dark Mode and rich updates -- "],[78,"sorry, independence for watchOS.\n\n"],[81,"On iOS, a new Dark Mode and "],[83,"great app updates.\n\n"],[85,"And finally, on iPadOS, a "],[87,"powerful operating system that "],[89,"now stands on its own. "],[91,"Sorry, the monitors aren't "],[93,"working down here.\n\n"],[97,"There we go. "],[98,"One of those is working, so I will go over to the left. "],[100,"Now these platforms represent a "],[102,"diverse range of devices and "],[104,"building great support for them "],[105,"is easy, thanks to a choice of "],[107,"many tools and APIs like "],[109,"AutoLayout, Size Classes and "],[111,"SwiftUI. "],[113,"So no more letterbox. "],[114,"Your users get the best "],[115,"experience when your app works "],[117,"well on a wide range of device "],[119,"sizes. "],[120,"And starting next spring, it "],[121,"will be an app store requirement "],[123,"to deliver UI that adapts to "],[125,"different screen sizes. "],[126,"Now tvOS is offering cool new "],[129,"capabilities -- "],[135,"There we go.\n\n"],[141,"Now tvOS is offering cool new "],[142,"capabilities for developers this "],[144,"year, including multi-user "],[146,"support for third-party apps, "],[147,"new UI elements and options, "],[149,"SwiftUI and of course support "],[151,"for Xbox and PlayStation game "],[154,"controllers.\n\n"],[157,"Now this morning we announced an "],[159,"incredible new hardware platform "],[161,"with the new Mac Pro. "],[162,"Do we love it? "],[166,"It is incredible, and it will "],[167,"really unlock amazing new kinds "],[169,"of apps.\n\n"],[170,"And we also built technologies "],[172,"that span all of our platforms, "],[174,"and we'll have a look at a few "],[176,"of these areas today, including "],[178,"accessibility, privacy, machine "],[180,"learning, Siri, augmented "],[182,"reality and finally Metal.\n\n"],[186,"Now we want to focus on these "],[187,"three big areas this afternoon, "],[188,"and we're going to start with "],[189,"developer productivity. "],[191,"Now everyone in this room knows "],[193,"that great tools can "],[195,"dramatically improve your "],[196,"productivity. "],[197,"Great tools give you more time "],[199,"to be creative and they let you "],[201,"build better apps. "],[203,"And the foundation of that "],[204,"experience is the programming "],[206,"language. "],[207,"Over the last five years, Swift "],[209,"has matured and is built into "],[211,"every Apple platform. "],[213,"And Swift gives us the "],[214,"foundation for SwiftUI.\n\n"],[217,"And Xcode is so much more than a "],[219,"code debugger -- sorry, code "],[221,"editor and debugger. "],[223,"It includes everything that you "],[224,"need to build an app, including "],[227,"support for continuous "],[228,"integration and testing. "],[229,"And it gives you tools that let "],[232,"you explore new technologies "],[234,"such as machine learning and "],[235,"augmented reality. "],[237,"And finally, built on the strong "],[239,"foundation of our platforms, the "],[241,"SwiftUI framework will "],[242,"revolutionize how you build user "],[244,"interfaces. "],[245,"And together, these three "],[247,"elements deliver a whole new "],[248,"level of productivity and they "],[250,"will fundamentally transform how "],[252,"all of you build apps. "],[254,"Now, are you ready to dive right "],[256,"into SwiftUI? "],[260,"Let's have Josh come up and tell "],[261,"us more. "],[262,"Josh? "],[266,"Thanks, Sebastien. "],[267,"Okay, so SwiftUI, as you saw "],[271,"this morning, is a brand-new "],[272,"user interface framework built "],[274,"from the ground up in Swift for "],[276,"Swift. "],[277,"We designed it to let you write "],[278,"less code and have the code that "],[280,"you do write be better code, "],[282,"while letting you use more of "],[284,"that code across all Apple "],[286,"platforms.\n\n"],[287,"Now first of all, there's so "],[289,"much functionality built into "],[290,"each individual line that you "],[292,"write that you're just going to "],[293,"write way less code. "],[295,"So let's take the app for "],[296,"choosing macOS release names "],[297,"that we looked at this morning, "],[299,"but without the animated "],[300,"transitions. "],[301,"If you've written an app with "],[302,"UIKit before, you know the types "],[304,"of pieces that you need in order "],[305,"to build this interface. "],[307,"It's not a lot of views, but "],[309,"there are many individual "],[310,"details that you need to get "],[311,"right. "],[312,"With SwiftUI, it is way less "],[315,"code. "],[316,"Fewer than 20 lines focused on "],[318,"just three key things. "],[320,"First, a few lines to define the "],[322,"structure and layout of your "],[323,"views. "],[324,"Then some image and text views "],[327,"to display your content.\n\n"],[330,"And finally, parameters and "],[331,"modifiers to adjust how it all "],[333,"looks.\n\n"],[334,"Now let' stake a look a little "],[335,"bit more closely at just a few "],[336,"of these lines. "],[338,"The scrolling list itself is "],[339,"barely any code at all. "],[341,"You just declare the list and "],[343,"then describe the model objects "],[345,"to be used in each row. "],[346,"There's no setup, there's no "],[348,"configuration and there's no "],[349,"callbacks. "],[350,"Now the image at the top is just "],[352,"as simple. "],[353,"You display an image, clip it to "],[354,"a circle and add a shadow. "],[356,"And it's not just less code. "],[359,"It's better code. "],[360,"We designed the API to make the "],[362,"obvious approach be the right "],[364,"approach. "],[365,"The right way to create this "],[367,"label is exactly the one line of "],[369,"code that you would think to write. "],[370,"It supports dynamic type, Dark "],[372,"Mode and more. "],[373,"In fact, even the string "],[375,"interpolation used here is fully "],[376,"localizable.\n\n"],[378,"This simplicity eliminates "],[379,"entire categories of errors. "],[382,"Looking at our list again, its "],[383,"rows update automatically if the "],[385,"model changes, ensuring that "],[387,"your UI is always up to date and "],[388,"never displaying out-of-date "],[390,"data. And it's easy to read too. "],[393,"The code for this image with a "],[394,"corner radius of three says "],[396,"exactly that.\n\n"],[398,"Reading SwiftUI is like having "],[399,"someone explain that interface "],[401,"to you. "],[402,"And SwiftUi's code is available "],[404,"everywhere, helping you reuse "],[406,"more of your code across all "],[408,"Apple platforms. Now you've long been able to "],[410,"share your model and low-level "],[412,"drawing and compositing code, "],[414,"but higher-level UI code has "],[415,"remained mostly "],[416,"platform-specific. "],[417,"With SwiftUI, we're raising that "],[419,"bar, enabling you to share far "],[421,"more. "],[422,"Now of course you're still going "],[423,"to want to tailor your "],[424,"interfaces for each individual "],[425,"platform to ensure that your app "],[427,"feels great everywhere that you "],[429,"deploy it. "],[430,"But with SwiftUI's common set of "],[432,"API patterns, you can learn "],[433,"those tools once and then apply "],[435,"them everywhere, getting you a "],[437,"native interface on each "],[438,"platform you deploy to.\n\n"],[440,"SwiftUI is designed with a "],[442,"strong set of four core "],[444,"principles. "],[445,"First, a declarative syntax "],[447,"shifts UI programming away from "],[449,"how to update the screen and "],[451,"instead lets you just focus on "],[452,"what you want to display.\n\n"],[454,"For example, let's say that you "],[455,"want to build a label with a "],[456,"headline font and a gray color. "],[459,"Describing how to get that is a "],[460,"multi-step process with many "],[462,"steps having to happen in a "],[464,"specific order. "],[465,"But describing what you want "],[468,"requires no translation. "],[470,"Text that says Done with a font "],[472,"for a headline that's colored "],[474,"gray. "],[475,"SwiftUI lets you say exactly "],[477,"that with a great new "],[478,"declarative syntax. "],[479,"And it's the minimum code "],[481,"necessary to describe exactly "],[483,"your idea. And iteration becomes "],[485,"significantly faster as well. "],[487,"If you later need to change that "],[488,"label to become a button, that's "],[490,"a one-line change.\n\n"],[494,"I know, it's pretty great.\n\n"],[500,"All right, so our second principle is that we should "],[501,"provide automatic functionality "],[503,"whenever it's possible. "],[504,"This eliminates the need for a "],[506,"huge amount of code that you "],[507,"used to have to write by hand. "],[509,"Our app for naming macOS "],[510,"releases is pretty simple, yet "],[512,"it does include a huge amount of "],[514,"automatic functionality. "],[515,"We get default handling of "],[517,"spacing and safe area insets. "],[520,"Localizability and layout "],[521,"adjustments for right-to-left "],[523,"languages. "],[524,"Dynamic type, Dark Mode and so "],[527,"much more, all from that one "],[528,"minimal description. "],[530,"It's an incredible amount of "],[531,"automatic functionality for a "],[533,"small amount of code, but there "],[534,"is one more thing that is just "],[536,"so important that it really "],[537,"deserves special attention. "],[540,"Our modern interfaces are "],[541,"interactive and they're "],[542,"animated. "],[543,"And with SwiftUI, that same "],[545,"interface declaration is also "],[546,"automatically fully animatable.\n\n"],[549,"Animations can be enabled for "],[551,"the entire hierarchy with just "],[552,"one line of code. "],[554,"There's no bookkeeping, there's "],[555,"no preparation and there's never "],[557,"any cleanup. "],[558,"If you've used Keynote Magic "],[559,"Move animations before, SwiftUI "],[561,"animations are that easy and "],[564,"even more powerful.\n\n"],[566,"And for views that are added and "],[567,"removed, you can specify how "],[569,"they transition in and out with "],[571,"just one more line of code. "],[574,"While animations are in "],[575,"progress, your app remains fully "],[576,"interactive and responsive and "],[578,"ready to handle user input at "],[579,"any time. "],[580,"And if the user ever interrupts "],[581,"one of those animations or if "],[583,"you need to move to a new "],[584,"location, SwiftUI handles all of "],[586,"that automatically too.\n\n"],[589,"Now our third principle is that "],[591,"compositional APIs are easier to "],[593,"learn and let you iterate a lot "],[595,"faster.\n\n"],[597,"We've looked at how we can "],[598,"declare an individual view like "],[599,"this text label. "],[600,"But declaring more complex views "],[602,"is just as easy. "],[603,"You just compose together "],[604,"multiple smaller pieces. "],[606,"Containers like horizontal and "],[607,"vertical stacks let you easily "],[609,"build powerful layouts by just "],[611,"combining together multiple "],[612,"simple pieces.\n\n"],[614,"And SwiftUI applies composition "],[616,"to view properties as well, "],[617,"using a standard modifier "],[619,"syntax. "],[620,"A common set of modifiers can be "],[621,"applied to any view, like color "],[623,"applied here to make this text "],[625,"gray.\n\n"],[626,"This compositional approach lets "],[627,"you learn a small set of views "],[629,"and modifiers and then combine "],[631,"them together to create "],[632,"progressively more powerful "],[633,"interfaces. "],[635,"And our final principle is that "],[637,"your interface should always be "],[639,"in a consistent state. "],[641,"Your UI is a reflection of your "],[642,"app's data, so the two should "],[644,"always be in synch at all times. "],[646,"With traditional APIs, this can "],[648,"be error-prone. "],[649,"But with SwiftUI, your interface "],[651,"updates automatically any time "],[653,"the data changes.\n\n"],[655,"Now there are two common places "],[656,"that your data might likely come "],[657,"from. "],[658,"Now the first are your model "],[659,"objects. "],[660,"And you can use your existing "],[661,"model objects directly by simply "],[663,"conforming them to a new "],[664,"bindable object protocol. "],[666,"Its only requirement is that you "],[668,"specify when the data in your "],[669,"model changes. "],[670,"Now the second place is "],[672,"temporary UI state, like whether "],[673,"the view is currently in editing "],[675,"mode. These are declared using a "],[676,"simple state wrapper applied to "],[678,"any property on your view. "],[680,"We're all used to every property "],[682,"on every view being mutable, but "],[685,"once you start using SwiftUI, "],[686,"you're going to be shocked to "],[687,"realize how little mutable state "],[689,"your app actually needs. "],[692,"Now whenever your model or state "],[694,"changes, that UI is going to "],[696,"update automatically. "],[698,"And because it's all Swift code, "],[699,"you get this behavior while "],[700,"still being able to use your "],[701,"model objects directly within "],[703,"that interface declaration. "],[705,"You can even transform and "],[706,"format values in line with no "],[708,"additional indirection needed. "],[711,"For example, this string interpolation can be used to "],[713,"format a date, resulting in "],[714,"fully localized formatted text. "],[718,"All of this means that with "],[719,"Swift UI, you're going to write "],[721,"less code and get a more "],[722,"consistent UI.\n\n"],[724,"Those are the four core "],[725,"principles of SwiftUI. "],[727,"A powerful declarative syntax "],[729,"enabling a huge amount of "],[730,"automatic functionality with a "],[732,"compositional API that ensures "],[734,"your interface is always in a "],[735,"consistent state.\n\n"],[737,"And a great new framework "],[739,"deserves incredible tools. "],[741,"And we've created a whole "],[742,"brand-new workflow within Xcode "],[743,"designed from the ground up for "],[745,"SwiftUI. "],[746,"You get the power and "],[748,"flexibility of code combined "],[750,"with the ease of use and rapid "],[751,"iteration of a UI tool. "],[754,"You always have access to both "],[755,"at all times, so you'll never "],[756,"have to choose between them "],[757,"again. "],[759,"And because the tools work on "],[760,"your actual existing source "],[761,"code, you have a truly live "],[763,"development experience. "],[765,"Now to really understand how "],[767,"amazing this workflow is, you "],[768,"just need to see it again live. "],[769,"And to show it to you now, I'll "],[771,"invite Kevin up to give you a "],[772,"demo.\n\n"],[779,"Thanks, Josh. "],[780,"You guys ready to have some fun? "],[782,"All right, so I'm building a "],[783,"hiking app and I want to add a "],[784,"view to my table view cell that "],[786,"tells me how difficult a trail "],[788,"is. So we're going to start in the "],[790,"library. "],[791,"We're going to have some text. "],[792,"And as I'm dragging, Xcode is "],[794,"suggesting layouts for me. "],[796,"Now I just tell Xcode where I "],[797,"want it and Xcode figures out "],[799,"the layout for me. "],[801,"And now we can edit the "],[802,"properties of this view. "],[803,"So I'm just going to command "],[804,"click in the canvas here and get "],[806,"custom-tailored inspectors right "],[808,"here. Let's make this text a little "],[810,"bit smaller. Now watch -- watch the code "],[812,"while I do this. "],[813,"You'll see it writes the code "],[815,"for me.\n\n"],[817,"Now, we can do the same thing "],[819,"over here in the source editor "],[820,"by just editing the code. "],[822,"And you can see Xcode builds and "],[824,"runs my code and updates the "],[825,"canvas on the right.\n\n"],[828,"Now no matter where I'm working, "],[830,"I get access to all of my design "],[832,"tools. "],[833,"So I'm just going to command "],[834,"click on this V stack, going to "],[835,"open up the inspectors. "],[836,"And again I can just modify the "],[838,"properties that I want. "],[839,"It's just so fast to iterate. "],[842,"Now, you might notice that this "],[845,"view has a couple inputs like "],[846,"this title and this difficulty. "],[848,"So how does Xcode know what data "],[851,"to show in the preview? "],[853,"This has always been one of the challenges with UI development: "],[855,"what data do we show during "],[857,"design time? "],[858,"And this is why we invented "],[860,"Xcode previews. "],[861,"What is a preview? "],[862,"I'll show you. "],[863,"So let me scroll down here.\n\n"],[865,"This snippet of code here -- a "],[867,"preview is just a snippet of "],[868,"code in my application that "],[870,"configures it for design time. "],[872,"Because it's in my application, "],[874,"I get access to all the code in "],[876,"my project. "],[877,"And because it's in my project, "],[878,"I can check it in and share it "],[880,"with my team members. "],[881,"And it's so easy to try "],[882,"different data. "],[883,"Now actually here Half Dome is "],[884,"pretty hard. "],[885,"So let's see what it looks like "],[886,"at hard. "],[887,"And that's because it's 16 "],[889,"miles, not 6. "],[890,"And that's really compiling "],[891,"code.\n\n"],[893,"Now because this is SwiftUI "],[894,"code, I get access to all the "],[897,"modifiers that I would use for "],[898,"the rest of my UI development. "],[901,"So we can see what it looks like "],[902,"in Dark Mode. "],[904,"And I also have preview-specific "],[905,"modifiers as well. "],[906,"So by default previews are the "],[908,"size of a device, but since "],[910,"we're working on a table view "],[911,"cell, let's just focus in on "],[913,"that content. So I'll just make that the size "],[915,"that fits. "],[917,"Okay, now here is the really "],[918,"cool thing about previews. "],[919,"You can have as many as you "],[921,"want. "],[922,"So let's add a second preview "],[924,"with completely different data. "],[926,"But let's not stop there. "],[928,"Let's command click, repeat it a "],[931,"couple of times. "],[932,"Let's enumerate over some common "],[934,"dynamic type sizes and then "],[936,"let's configure our cell to use "],[938,"that dynamic type size. "],[939,"And there at a glance I can see "],[941,"my cell with light mode, Dark "],[942,"Mode, multiple different dynamic "],[944,"type sizes all at the same time.\n\n"],[956,"Now when I tap on this cell, I "],[957,"want to go to a detailed view. "],[959,"So let's switch over to that "],[960,"file now and take a look. "],[962,"Now I've learned through the "],[964,"years of hiking that you should "],[965,"never judge a trail by its name. "],[968,"So it's really important to me "],[970,"that we can configure our detail "],[972,"view to make that image really "],[974,"large. "],[975,"And I've already done that with "],[976,"some SwiftUI state here. "],[978,"So when we tap the banner, we "],[979,"want to toggle that expansion "],[981,"state. "],[982,"Now I can test that right here "],[984,"in the UI just by clicking this "],[986,"play button. "],[987,"This takes any preview that I "],[988,"have and makes it fully "],[990,"interactive. "],[991,"So I can just click and test out "],[993,"those different expansion "],[995,"states. "],[996,"Now we can really polish this up "],[998,"with an animation. It's so easy. "],[1000,"So I can just wrap my state "],[1001,"change in a whip animation "],[1003,"block, and now I get a beautiful "],[1006,"default animation.\n\n"],[1017,"And it's just as easy to "],[1018,"customize that. "],[1019,"So let's slow it down for some "],[1021,"dramatic effect, and now I get a "],[1023,"beautiful animation opening it "],[1025,"up. Now what's so cool about SwiftUI "],[1027,"is that every animation is "],[1029,"cancellable and reversible, "],[1030,"leaving my application "],[1031,"responsive the whole time.\n\n"],[1034,"Okay, so we have a table view "],[1036,"cell and we have a detail view. "],[1038,"So let's put it all together. "],[1039,"So I'm going to switch over to "],[1041,"my last value here, which has a "],[1043,"bunch of different trails and a "],[1045,"list. "],[1046,"So what I want to do is I "],[1047,"actually want to see what this "],[1049,"looks like on a real device. "],[1051,"So with the click of a button -- "],[1052,"let's click this -- Xcode is "],[1053,"going to build my project for "],[1054,"the device. "],[1055,"It's going to install it and "],[1056,"it's going to launch my preview "],[1058,"right here on the device. And you can see it's fully "],[1059,"interactive right here. "],[1061,"So first let's use that cell "],[1063,"that we built. "],[1064,"So I'll just change this text to "],[1066,"be a trail cell. "],[1069,"Now you can see we're seeing our "],[1070,"trails show up there. "],[1071,"And now when I tap on this, I "],[1073,"want it to go to our detail view "],[1074,"that we built. "],[1075,"This is so easy with SwiftUI. "],[1076,"It's just going to wrap this in "],[1078,"a navigation button, and that "],[1080,"tells us to go to our detailed "],[1082,"view. And now you can see the chevron "],[1083,"shows up. "],[1084,"So let's check out Snow Creek "],[1085,"and let's move in on that "],[1087,"picture. And okay, snowy and difficult. "],[1090,"That does not sound like a fun "],[1091,"trail. "],[1092,"So what I'm going to do with "],[1093,"just one line of SwiftUI code is "],[1095,"add swipe to delete. "],[1096,"And now we can say, \"We don't "],[1099,"want to do that trail.\" "],[1100,"And now lastly, let's see what "],[1103,"it looks like in Dark Mode. "],[1104,"Without any work, it's going to "],[1107,"put my preview in Dark Mode and "],[1108,"you can see it looks beautiful.\n\n"],[1119,"We can tap on our valley floor, "],[1121,"zoom in. "],[1122,"And that looks like a great way "],[1124,"to end the week. "],[1125,"So we just built an app with "],[1126,"navigation, dynamic type size, "],[1127,"light mode, Dark Mode, multiple "],[1129,"different data and saw on the "],[1131,"real device all without ever "],[1133,"building and running. "],[1134,"Now that's fun. "],[1135,"All right, Josh, back to you.\n\n"],[1145,"Thanks, Kevin. "],[1146,"All right, this is really an "],[1147,"incredible new workflow for "],[1148,"fully native code. "],[1150,"What you do in the tool is always debuggable, diffable, "],[1152,"searchable, and understandable. "],[1155,"And because you can always edit "],[1156,"the code directly, you get "],[1157,"incredible flexibility in your "],[1159,"workflow. "],[1160,"And SwiftUI is deeply integrated "],[1161,"in all of our operating systems, "],[1163,"so using it results in a fully "],[1165,"native app for whichever "],[1166,"platforms you target. "],[1167,"You get the same performance, "],[1168,"the same behavior and the same "],[1170,"controls as any other native "],[1172,"app. "],[1173,"And you can adopt SwiftUI at "],[1174,"your own pace. "],[1175,"You can use it for anything, "],[1176,"from just one view in your app "],[1178,"all the way up to the entire "],[1179,"application. "],[1181,"It works seamlessly with all of "],[1182,"your existing UIKit, AppKit and "],[1184,"WatchKit code so you don't need "],[1185,"to rewrite anything. "],[1187,"And to get you up to speed "],[1188,"quickly, our documentation team "],[1190,"has developed a brand-new style "],[1191,"of interactive documentation. "],[1193,"It quickly takes you "],[1194,"step-by-step from creating a new "],[1196,"project all the way up to "],[1197,"building a fully interactive "],[1199,"interface. "],[1200,"So you'll be up to speed in no time.\n\n"],[1208,"So that's SwiftUI and some of "],[1209,"the new tools in Xcode. "],[1211,"Of course, this is a huge year "],[1213,"for Swift and Xcode, so there's "],[1215,"even more to this story. "],[1216,"And to tell you more about it, "],[1217,"I'll hand things off to Matthew. "],[1219,"Thanks.\n\n"],[1225,"Thank you, Josh. "],[1226,"Our tools released this year "],[1228,"bring together innovations in "],[1229,"Swift and Xcode to deliver some "],[1232,"awesome results. "],[1233,"So let's start with Swift.\n\n"],[1236,"Now in our fifth year, Swift has "],[1238,"matured and is continuing to "],[1239,"leap forward. "],[1240,"Where our newest and flagship "],[1242,"technologies, from machine "],[1243,"learning to augmented reality "],[1245,"are possible only because of "],[1246,"Swift and it now being part of "],[1248,"our OS.\n\n"],[1250,"To achieve this, earlier this "],[1251,"spring we introduced ABI "],[1253,"stability which reduces the size "],[1255,"of your apps by using a single "],[1257,"shared Swift runtime.\n\n"],[1265,"And we are following that up today with module stability "],[1268,"which ensures compatibility -- "],[1269,"yes.\n\n"],[1274,"This completes the picture by "],[1275,"ensuring compatibility for your "],[1277,"binaries with the current and "],[1278,"future versions of the Swift "],[1280,"compiler.\n\n"],[1281,"And these come alongside a "],[1282,"number of other language "],[1284,"features, tools editions and "],[1286,"performance and code size "],[1287,"improvements, all which further "],[1289,"extend the potential Swift "],[1290,"brings to your projects.\n\n"],[1293,"So Swift is already the language "],[1295,"for your apps and now more than "],[1297,"ever for common code to share "],[1298,"across all Apple platforms.\n\n"],[1301,"In fact, sharing is the reason "],[1302,"we created Swift Packages which "],[1305,"are the best way to develop and "],[1306,"share your own code and reuse "],[1308,"code from others. "],[1309,"And today we have two big "],[1311,"announcements.\n\n"],[1313,"GitHub will be adding support "],[1314,"for Swift packages to the GitHub "],[1316,"Package Registry.\n\n"],[1326,"Which is perfect because Xcode "],[1327,"now seamlessly supports Swift "],[1329,"packages for apps on iOS, iPadOS "],[1330,"and all of our platforms.\n\n"],[1340,"Swift packages are top-level "],[1341,"items in your workspaces, always "],[1343,"visible, always accessible, and "],[1345,"deeply integrated. "],[1347,"Packages from the community and "],[1348,"those packages you create get "],[1350,"instant access to all of Xcode's "],[1352,"work flows for source control, "],[1353,"debugging, testing, the works. "],[1356,"So Swift packages built into "],[1358,"Xcode, it's sharing code the way "],[1360,"you've always wanted.\n\n"],[1363,"Now that's just the start of our "],[1364,"Xcode release this year, which "],[1365,"is focused on maximizing your "],[1367,"productivity. "],[1368,"And we have a number of "],[1369,"improvements today to share with "],[1370,"you as we take Xcode up to 11.\n\n"],[1374,"So let's get started with one of "],[1376,"our biggest changes which is the "],[1378,"Xcode Workspace. "],[1380,"We are giving you full editorial "],[1382,"control. You can now create and manage "],[1384,"editors however you like. "],[1386,"Whatever your preferred style "],[1388,"and layout is, you can simply "],[1389,"add and remove editors whenever "],[1391,"and wherever you see fit.\n\n"],[1400,"And even better, your workspaces "],[1402,"can now focus too. "],[1404,"So you can take any editor and "],[1408,"maximize it, and then when "],[1412,"you're done, just put it back "],[1413,"and it will go right back to "],[1414,"where you started.\n\n"],[1421,"So whether you're working on the smallest of laptops or with the "],[1423,"largest of displays, your "],[1425,"workspace now works for you.\n\n"],[1429,"Now the related content in our "],[1430,"editors, the smart selections "],[1433,"like counterparts, are also "],[1434,"getting a huge boost.\n\n"],[1437,"There are new options like "],[1438,"previews, canvas, live views and "],[1441,"more. "],[1442,"You can use the related content "],[1443,"in any editor in your workspace. "],[1446,"And you'll like this one best of "],[1447,"all. "],[1448,"When there is no content, they "],[1449,"automatically disappear so you "],[1451,"no longer need to manager their "],[1452,"visibility.\n\n"],[1459,"Now once you get your workspace "],[1460,"set up, it's all about the "],[1462,"editing, and I'd like to show "],[1463,"you a quick demonstration of "],[1464,"some of the new source editing "],[1465,"features we have for you this "],[1466,"year.\n\n"],[1479,"To help you configure each editor the way you like, there's "],[1481,"a new Options menu in the upper "],[1483,"right. "],[1484,"You can see here I can enable "],[1485,"the assistants or any of the "],[1486,"related content. "],[1487,"I could turn on code coverage or "],[1489,"source control authors. "],[1490,"I'm going to turn on our newest "],[1491,"feature, Mini map.\n\n"],[1494,"So the mini map gives you a "],[1495,"structural overview of your file "],[1497,"to help you navigate. "],[1499,"You can see documentations, "],[1500,"method and functions. "],[1502,"It makes it really easy to move "],[1503,"about the file.\n\n"],[1505,"If you'd like to leave yourself "],[1506,"some other landmarks, you can "],[1507,"use the mark syntax to add "],[1509,"labels and horizontal dividers "],[1511,"that show up in your source and "],[1512,"in the mini map.\n\n"],[1520,"Now if I hover over the mini "],[1521,"map, you'll see the symbolic "],[1522,"landmarks for the file. "],[1524,"Here's a pro tip: hold down the "],[1526,"command key and you'll see all "],[1528,"of the landmarks for the file to "],[1529,"make it really easy to navigate "],[1530,"to exactly where you want to go.\n\n"],[1537,"And the mini map will show you issues, test failures, even "],[1539,"in-file find results. "],[1541,"And we've made it fully "],[1542,"accessible.\n\n"],[1544,"You'll find our source editor "],[1545,"now pops and your code is more "],[1546,"vivid as we've deepened our "],[1547,"syntax coloring. "],[1549,"You'll also see that we've "],[1550,"increased our documentation "],[1551,"support here with italics, bold "],[1553,"and code voice in the "],[1554,"documentation. "],[1556,"You'll also see that when you "],[1557,"add documentation, it "],[1558,"automatically adds in missing "],[1559,"parameters that you may have "],[1560,"added after you typed your "],[1562,"documentation.\n\n"],[1570,"And what's even better is to help you keep your documentation "],[1572,"and code in synch. "],[1573,"You'll find Edit All and Scope "],[1574,"now changes both, all at the "],[1575,"same time.\n\n"],[1582,"Now we also wanted to add some "],[1583,"additional help to help you keep "],[1584,"track of your changes. "],[1586,"If I'd like to review all of the "],[1587,"changes for this file, I can "],[1589,"open up the new Source Control "],[1590,"History Inspector which shows me "],[1592,"all the changes that have been "],[1593,"made to this file, and I can "],[1594,"quickly jump to any commit. "],[1595,"And because it's in the "],[1597,"inspector, this now works for "],[1598,"any file type in your project.\n\n"],[1600,"To help you review local "],[1602,"changes, we've also improved the "],[1604,"change bar. "],[1605,"When I hover over the change "],[1606,"bar, it shows me the local "],[1607,"changes. "],[1608,"But I can now have it show me "],[1609,"the code before the change that "],[1611,"I made to get a quick snippet.\n\n"],[1619,"And of course it's live, so as I "],[1621,"start typing, it will update to "],[1624,"keep me up-to-date. "],[1625,"So those are just some of the "],[1627,"many source editing features "],[1628,"you'll find in Xcode 11.\n\n"],[1638,"Okay, so testing is another key "],[1640,"development workflow. "],[1641,"And Xcode already has great "],[1643,"support for writing tests, which "],[1645,"of course you all already know "],[1646,"because you're writing lots of "],[1647,"them, right? "],[1648,"Yep. Yeah.\n\n"],[1650,"Excellent. That's what we like to hear. "],[1652,"Now what you may not know is "],[1653,"that Xcode can do even more with "],[1655,"your tests by using fantastic "],[1657,"tools like runtime issues, "],[1658,"sanitizers, localization "],[1660,"simulation. "],[1661,"And we add more of these every "],[1662,"year. "],[1663,"With so many options, what's "],[1664,"been missing is a way to combine "],[1666,"them all in one place to be used "],[1668,"in parallel. "],[1669,"And for that we are adding test "],[1671,"plans.\n\n"],[1673,"Now the power of test plans "],[1674,"comes from running your tests in "],[1676,"many configurations.\n\n"],[1678,"With a few simple selections, "],[1679,"you can instantly test for your "],[1681,"global audience. "],[1683,"And this configuration is also "],[1684,"perfect for capturing "],[1685,"screenshots for the App Store or "],[1687,"collecting details for your "],[1688,"localizers.\n\n"],[1690,"Yeah, it's okay to applaud for "],[1691,"that. This is a big deal.\n\n"],[1697,"You can then see your app from "],[1698,"every angle by adding in other "],[1700,"diagnostics, tools and "],[1701,"parameters. "],[1703,"And your coverage increases even "],[1704,"further when you run your test "],[1706,"plans against many devices and "],[1708,"OS combinations to get a fully "],[1710,"comprehensive view of how your "],[1711,"app is doing. "],[1712,"Now for testing at this scale, "],[1714,"test plans work perfectly with "],[1716,"Xcode Server which can take full "],[1718,"advantage of the new Mac Pro and "],[1720,"with Xcode's new parallel "],[1721,"testing on simulators and "],[1723,"devices.\n\n"],[1724,"The result with test plans is "],[1725,"you now have one command that "],[1727,"does all of the testing for your "],[1728,"apps. "],[1729,"So this is a major advancement.\n\n"],[1739,"Now often when testing and debugging, it's necessary to "],[1741,"replicate user scenarios. "],[1743,"And our new Device Conditions "],[1744,"answers the call.\n\n"],[1746,"You can now set varied "],[1747,"conditions for network "],[1748,"throughput and thermal states on "],[1750,"your devices and see how your "],[1751,"apps respond. "],[1753,"Now rest assured these are "],[1754,"actually just simulations. "],[1755,"We're not actually going to make "],[1756,"your devices get super-hot here.\n\n"],[1759,"You can enable the conditions in "],[1760,"Xcode's Devices window. "],[1762,"And the devices will display "],[1763,"banners when the conditions are "],[1764,"active. "],[1765,"You can tap the banner to "],[1766,"disable the conditions and Xcode "],[1768,"will automatically terminate the "],[1770,"conditions when you disconnect "],[1771,"the devices.\n\n"],[1773,"Now for all the testing you're "],[1774,"going to be doing, we've also "],[1776,"improved our result bundles "],[1777,"which are now standalone. "],[1779,"Whether you create them in Xcode "],[1781,"or from the command line, you "],[1782,"can share them via email, attach "],[1783,"them to bugs and then just "],[1785,"double-click on them to open "],[1786,"them back in Xcode to review all "],[1788,"of the details.\n\n"],[1796,"Now to help you improve your "],[1797,"apps even further, we are "],[1799,"introducing two new feedback "],[1801,"tools. "],[1802,"First, app performance metrics "],[1804,"for iOS and iPadOS App Store "],[1806,"apps.\n\n"],[1808,"When users opt into sharing "],[1809,"analytics, you'll received "],[1811,"anonymized metrics for battery "],[1813,"life, launch time, memory use "],[1815,"and more. "],[1816,"These metrics are aggregated and "],[1818,"displayed in the organizer "],[1819,"alongside the crash and energy "],[1821,"logs, and are a great way to "],[1822,"monitor and improve the "],[1823,"performance of your app with "],[1825,"each build.\n\n"],[1827,"These aggregated metrics, we "],[1828,"started collecting them in the "],[1829,"spring with iOS 12.2. "],[1832,"So many of your apps will "],[1833,"already have data to review.\n\n"],[1836,"Now another great source of "],[1837,"feedback is directly from your "],[1839,"users, and Test Flight will now "],[1840,"let users share what they think.\n\n"],[1843,"Test Flight apps automatically "],[1845,"enable user feedback.\n\n"],[1847,"When a user takes a screenshot "],[1849,"in your app, they will have a "],[1850,"new option to share it as beta "],[1852,"feedback, optionally adding in "],[1853,"their comments.\n\n"],[1861,"You can review all the feedback "],[1862,"on App Store Connect and "],[1864,"download all the details for "],[1865,"your bug tracking systems.\n\n"],[1868,"So all these features today are "],[1870,"just a small taste of our Xcode "],[1872,"release, which brings together "],[1873,"innovations in Swift, the SDK "],[1874,"and across all of our tools. "],[1877,"All this to help you do your "],[1878,"best work faster than ever. "],[1880,"And that is Xcode 11.\n\n"],[1891,"And now I'd like to invite "],[1892,"Sebastien back to tell us more "],[1893,"about Apple's platforms. "],[1894,"Sebastien? "],[1898,"Thank you, Matthew. "],[1899,"Wasn't that amazing? "],[1902,"Really, really great features to "],[1903,"help all of you build better "],[1905,"apps. "],[1906,"So now let's switch to our "],[1907,"platforms. "],[1908,"And of course our platforms "],[1909,"themselves are tailored to "],[1911,"provide great experiences and "],[1913,"they really reflect the unique "],[1914,"way in which each of them is "],[1915,"used. "],[1916,"So some of what we're doing this "],[1918,"year is unique to each of them, "],[1919,"and what we're going to do now "],[1921,"is dive right in to macOS and "],[1923,"tell you what we're doing there. "],[1925,"macOS Catalina is a great "],[1929,"release with a rich set of "],[1930,"compelling new features such as "],[1932,"screen time and the new Music "],[1934,"app. And the Mac takes another great "],[1936,"step forward with amazing "],[1938,"productivity features such as "],[1939,"Sidecar. "],[1940,"We're going to love Sidecar, "],[1942,"right? "],[1947,"All right. Well, with an active installed "],[1948,"base of over 100 million users, "],[1951,"the Mac is a vibrant platform "],[1953,"with a rich app ecosystem. "],[1954,"And the Mac ecosystem is full of "],[1957,"powerful native apps that you "],[1958,"have created using our AppKit "],[1960,"framework. And a great example of this is "],[1962,"Pixelmator Pro.\n\n"],[1964,"Now AppKit is the powerful "],[1966,"framework that enables the full "],[1967,"capabilities of the Mac. "],[1968,"But we also recognize that there "],[1970,"are a number of apps available "],[1972,"for iPad that would be great to "],[1973,"run on the Mac, but you have not "],[1975,"always had time to use AppKit to "],[1977,"bring that to the Mac. "],[1979,"And so this year we're adding an "],[1981,"additional way to create native "],[1982,"Mac apps with the technology "],[1984,"that allows you to take an "],[1985,"iPadOS app and bring it to the "],[1987,"Mac with minimal effort.\n\n"],[1989,"We -- "],[1995,"Can you go back two slides? "],[1996,"Sorry.\n\n"],[2000,"One more. All right. "],[2002,"This is a huge opportunity for "],[2003,"the Mac to tap into the world's "],[2006,"largest app ecosystem. "],[2008,"There are over a million iPad "],[2009,"apps out there and we think many "],[2011,"of them would be really great on "],[2013,"the Mac as well.\n\n"],[2015,"Now to achieve this, we've "],[2017,"ported more than 40 frameworks "],[2018,"and libraries from iOS to the "],[2019,"Mac. "],[2020,"And if you're an existing iOS "],[2022,"developer that doesn't have a "],[2024,"Mac app yet, you're going to "],[2025,"love having the same APIs "],[2027,"available on both platforms. "],[2029,"In fact, we've made available "],[2030,"almost the entire iOS API set "],[2033,"with only a small number of "],[2034,"exceptions for unique mobile "],[2036,"features. "],[2038,"Now we achieved this by adapting "],[2040,"UI Kit as a native framework. "],[2041,"That enables iPad apps to run on "],[2043,"the Mac and feel just as fast "],[2045,"and fluid as other apps on the "],[2047,"platform.\n\n"],[2049,"And by integrating UI Kit "],[2050,"directly into macOS, many of the "],[2053,"fundamentals are automatic. "],[2055,"So many Mac desktop and "],[2056,"windowing features are added "],[2058,"without any work on your part, "],[2061,"and we adapt platform-unique "],[2062,"elements like touch controls to "],[2064,"keyboard and mouse input, saving "],[2066,"you a ton of work and giving you "],[2068,"a huge head start in your "],[2069,"development. "],[2070,"Now we've been working on this "],[2072,"technology for a number of years "],[2073,"and we're using it for our own "],[2075,"apps, which has allowed us to "],[2076,"prove out and refine the "],[2077,"technology before we make it "],[2079,"available to you in macOS "],[2081,"Catalina this year.\n\n"],[2083,"If you have an iPadOS app, "],[2085,"targeting the Mac is super easy. "],[2087,"There are basically three steps.\n\n"],[2090,"First, click the checkbox in "],[2092,"Xcode -- here we go.\n\n"],[2096,"That easy. In Xcode's Project Editor, and "],[2098,"turn on Mac support for your "],[2099,"project. "],[2100,"There you go. As easy as that. "],[2102,"And here's the magic. "],[2103,"That single project and target "],[2104,"builds apps for all three "],[2106,"platforms. "],[2107,"And when you make a change to "],[2108,"your source, all three apps "],[2110,"update automatically.\n\n"],[2113,"The second step is to ensure "],[2114,"that your app is great on the "],[2116,"iPad. "],[2118,"Better iPad apps make better Mac "],[2120,"apps as well. "],[2121,"So the work that you put in to "],[2123,"adopting the newest technologies "],[2124,"and optimizing for larger iPad "],[2126,"screens translates wonderfully "],[2128,"to the Mac.\n\n"],[2131,"Just following best practices "],[2133,"such as supporting external "],[2134,"keyboards will also result in "],[2136,"richer Mac experiences.\n\n"],[2139,"The third step is to take "],[2141,"advantage of specific Mac "],[2142,"capabilities. "],[2144,"And this is where you make "],[2145,"customizations that take full "],[2147,"advantage of typical "],[2149,"Mac-specific user interface "],[2150,"elements like full menus and "],[2152,"toolbars. And if applicable, sidebars and "],[2155,"their special materials. "],[2156,"Now to show you how easy this "],[2158,"is, I'd like to invite Matthew "],[2159,"back onstage for a demo. "],[2161,"Matthew? "],[2168,"Thank you, Sebastien.\n\n"],[2170,"Here we have our travel "],[2171,"application running in the iPad "],[2172,"Simulator. "],[2173,"It's a list view of locations. "],[2175,"When I select a location, the "],[2177,"globe will rotate. "],[2178,"And we have a logging area where "],[2179,"I can start keeping track of my "],[2181,"trips in a journal.\n\n"],[2183,"Let's follow Sebastien's three "],[2184,"steps and bring this app to the "],[2185,"Mac. "],[2186,"Step one, check the box.\n\n"],[2189,"I'll quit the simulator and here "],[2191,"in the target editor I'll check "],[2192,"the box for Mac support to "],[2194,"enable it.\n\n"],[2196,"That's it. "],[2197,"I can now build and run my "],[2198,"application for the Mac.\n\n"],[2200,"By checking the box, we added "],[2201,"the Mac as a destination. "],[2203,"So just like I can pick between "],[2204,"devices and simulators for my "],[2206,"app, I can now choose the Mac.\n\n"],[2208,"And here's the Mac app. "],[2210,"List View on the left, select "],[2212,"the location and log in.\n\n"],[2222,"I know, pretty powerful "],[2223,"checkbox. All right, let's move on to step "],[2226,"two, make a great iPad app.\n\n"],[2229,"I've not implemented any actions "],[2230,"from my List View, things like "],[2232,"Adding to Favorites or to Share. "],[2234,"When I implement those for the "],[2235,"iPad, they'll show up as a "],[2236,"context menu on the Mac. "],[2238,"It's a double win.\n\n"],[2240,"So I'll quit the Mac app and "],[2242,"change to my sidebar controller "],[2243,"here, and I'll just add a table "],[2245,"view delegate method that sets "],[2246,"up those menus for each item.\n\n"],[2249,"Okay. Let's move on to step "],[2250,"three.\n\n"],[2251,"I'd like the sidebar on my Mac "],[2253,"app to be vibrant. "],[2255,"Now this change doesn't happen "],[2256,"automatically because it's "],[2257,"something you should review to "],[2258,"make sure it's appropriate. "],[2260,"When you do find it's what you'd "],[2261,"like, it's a simple one-line "],[2263,"change to set the background "],[2265,"style to sidebar.\n\n"],[2267,"Okay, for our final change, I'd "],[2268,"like to add a menu bar to our "],[2270,"application. "],[2271,"So here in the storyboard I'll "],[2273,"bring up the library and I'll "],[2275,"search for a menu. "],[2277,"I'll grab a main menu and I'll "],[2278,"drag it out into my storyboard "],[2280,"and we'll open up the file menu.\n\n"],[2283,"I'd like to add a menu command "],[2284,"in here for the login action. "],[2286,"So we'll call this Login. "],[2288,"We'll give it a key equivalent "],[2289,"of Command-L. "],[2290,"And I just now need to connect "],[2292,"the menu item up to the action "],[2294,"that I'm already using for "],[2295,"Login.\n\n"],[2296,"Okay? That's it. "],[2298,"Let's build and run our changes. "],[2300,"I'm going to go up and hide "],[2302,"Xcode for the moment so we can "],[2303,"see our application.\n\n"],[2305,"Okay, so now we have the vibrant "],[2307,"sidebar. "],[2308,"When I select an item, I can "],[2309,"bring up a context menu and up "],[2312,"here in the File menu I now have "],[2314,"the Login action. "],[2316,"So just like that, three easy "],[2317,"steps.\n\n"],[2325,"Three easy steps to bring our "],[2326,"app to the Mac and make a great "],[2328,"user experience for all our "],[2329,"users. "],[2330,"Back to you, Sebastien.\n\n"],[2334,"Thank you, Matthew. "],[2335,"That was really amazing. "],[2336,"Doesn't this make you want to go "],[2337,"and try it out? "],[2339,"Yes. All right, in fact, over "],[2341,"the last few weeks we invited a "],[2342,"number of developers to take "],[2344,"this for a spin. "],[2345,"And the progress that they have "],[2346,"made in a few short weeks is "],[2348,"truly impressive. "],[2349,"Here's a sample of the iPad apps "],[2351,"that they already have running "],[2353,"on the Mac.\n\n"],[2354,"Now once you've built a Mac app, "],[2357,"the best way to distribute it to "],[2358,"your users is through the Mac "],[2359,"App Store. "],[2361,"It features the biggest catalog "],[2362,"of Mac Apps. "],[2363,"It's available in 155 countries "],[2366,"throughout the world and the Mac "],[2368,"App Store allows you to reach "],[2369,"every single Mac user. "],[2371,"Now we also built Gatekeeper to "],[2374,"give users flexibility and "],[2375,"choice on how they get their "],[2376,"apps while helping protect them "],[2378,"from malicious software. "],[2379,"And in macOS Catalina, "],[2381,"Gatekeeper will validate the "],[2382,"apps that you run from the "],[2383,"internet both at first launch "],[2385,"and periodically thereafter to "],[2387,"confirm that they're free of "],[2388,"known malware. "],[2390,"This is accomplished by "],[2391,"requiring developers to use the "],[2392,"notarization service that we "],[2394,"announced last year for both new "],[2396,"and updated apps. "],[2398,"So now you and your users can "],[2400,"safely get apps from both the "],[2401,"Mac App Store and the internet.\n\n"],[2404,"Notarization has already seen "],[2406,"broad adoption. "],[2407,"It's simple and fast with over "],[2409,"98% of submissions completing "],[2411,"within 15 minutes.\n\n"],[2413,"Now speaking of security, we're "],[2415,"continuing to invest in the "],[2416,"foundations of macOS and I'd "],[2418,"like to focus on three areas.\n\n"],[2421,"First, a new technology called "],[2423,"Driver Kit which allows you to "],[2424,"move your kernel extensions out "],[2426,"of the kernel and into user "],[2427,"space. "],[2428,"And by running these drivers and "],[2431,"extensions as user processes, we "],[2433,"improve the stability of macOS "],[2435,"for all of our users.\n\n"],[2437,"We identified the most common "],[2438,"use cases that have required "],[2439,"kernel extensions in the past, "],[2441,"and now we have a user space "],[2442,"alternative for over 75% of them "],[2445,"in macOS Catalina. "],[2447,"We encourage you to adopt Driver "],[2449,"Kit as future versions of macOS "],[2450,"will no longer run these types "],[2452,"of kernel extensions. "],[2454,"Next, we're improving the "],[2457,"stability of macOS by making the "],[2458,"system volume read-only. "],[2461,"Here's how it works. "],[2463,"Today there's a single volume "],[2464,"that includes user data, apps "],[2466,"and the operating system. "],[2468,"And to further isolate macOS "],[2469,"from changes, the Mac will now "],[2471,"be divided into two logical "],[2473,"volumes. "],[2474,"One for the operating system "],[2475,"files which will be read-only, "],[2478,"and the other for user data and "],[2480,"apps.\n\n"],[2483,"There you go.\n\n"],[2486,"This will further protect the "],[2487,"operating system from changes, "],[2489,"increase stability and set us up "],[2490,"to deliver future security "],[2492,"benefits. "],[2493,"Now some of you may have made "],[2494,"assumptions in your app or your "],[2496,"installer, and you'll want to "],[2497,"check that it works seamlessly "],[2499,"on macOS Catalina.\n\n"],[2502,"Finally, enhancements to app and "],[2504,"data protection. "],[2505,"We have spent the last few years "],[2507,"adding additional data "],[2508,"protection categories so that "],[2510,"users are in control of which "],[2512,"apps can access important files "],[2514,"like your photos or sensitive "],[2517,"sensors like your camera and "],[2519,"microphone on your Mac. "],[2521,"In macOS Catalina, we're "],[2523,"continuing this work by ensuring "],[2525,"that apps seek permission before "],[2526,"capturing input events, so "],[2528,"things like key presses or "],[2529,"screen recordings.\n\n"],[2534,"And we're also going to protect "],[2535,"user data on your Mac, so apps "],[2537,"will now have to seek permission "],[2538,"before accessing the files that "],[2540,"users keep on their desktop, "],[2542,"downloads, documents, iCloud "],[2544,"drive and external drives. "],[2547,"Yeah.\n\n"],[2552,"We are really excited about all "],[2553,"the enhancements that we're "],[2554,"bringing in macOS Catalina. "],[2556,"Now another platform that's got "],[2557,"some really big changes this "],[2559,"year is watchOS. "],[2560,"And to tell you more, I'd like "],[2562,"to invite Lori up on stage. "],[2564,"Lori? "],[2568,"Thanks, Sebastien.\n\n"],[2572,"This morning we introduced a "],[2573,"bunch of cool new features in "],[2574,"watchOS 6, including new health "],[2576,"apps like noise and cycle "],[2578,"tracking, activity trends, "],[2579,"audiobooks and more. "],[2581,"But the real story for watchOS 6 "],[2583,"is that it's now possible to "],[2584,"declare independence from the "],[2587,"phone and build fully "],[2588,"watch-focused experiences.\n\n"],[2596,"Thanks to cellular connectivity, "],[2597,"customers are increasingly "],[2598,"leaving their phones behind and "],[2599,"enjoying the freedom using just "],[2601,"their Apple Watch to stay "],[2602,"connected. "],[2603,"From running errands to running "],[2605,"workouts, from listening to "],[2606,"music to chatting with friends, "],[2608,"we want all users to enjoy great "],[2609,"Apple Watch experiences without "],[2611,"limitations. "],[2612,"And independent watch apps make "],[2614,"that possible.\n\n"],[2616,"We've taken a good look at the "],[2618,"challenges of developing for "],[2619,"Apple Watch and worked hard not "],[2621,"only to bring you new APIs that "],[2622,"make it possible to support "],[2624,"independent experiences, but "],[2626,"also to completely revamp the "],[2627,"experience of being an Apple "],[2628,"Watch developer.\n\n"],[2632,"What if I told you it was "],[2633,"possible to create a watch app "],[2636,"that's only a watch app? "],[2639,"If you've got an idea for a "],[2640,"great watch-only experience, "],[2642,"Xcode now makes it simple to "],[2643,"create a watch app that's just a "],[2644,"watch app. "],[2645,"So you can pursue your idea "],[2647,"without also having to build an "],[2648,"iOS app.\n\n"],[2651,"And if you already have an iOS "],[2653,"app, you can still build your "],[2654,"app to be completely independent "],[2656,"of its companion thanks to a "],[2658,"couple key changes we made in "],[2659,"watchOS 6 to support watch-only "],[2661,"apps, including making Apple "],[2664,"Watch a standalone push target. "],[2666,"You now have the option of "],[2667,"sending notifications directly "],[2668,"to the watch so you can update "],[2670,"both your users and your apps "],[2671,"data without relying on the "],[2673,"phone to mediate.\n\n"],[2680,"We're also supporting Cloud Kit "],[2681,"subscriptions and complication "],[2683,"pushes to help you keep your app "],[2684,"up-to-date.\n\n"],[2686,"And since asking users to sign "],[2688,"in on iPhone is not an option "],[2689,"when you don't have an iPhone "],[2690,"app, in watchOS 6 we're giving "],[2692,"you text fields so you can offer "],[2694,"account creation and sign-in "],[2695,"options directly on Apple Watch.\n\n"],[2701,"If you want to make account creation really easy, you can "],[2703,"even add an Assign with Apple "],[2704,"button to your app to let your "],[2705,"users set up an account and sign "],[2707,"in with the Apple ID they "],[2708,"already have. "],[2709,"No new passwords or text entry "],[2711,"required.\n\n"],[2713,"With watchOS 6 we're also "],[2714,"addressing a common watch-only "],[2715,"use case by bringing streaming "],[2717,"audio to watchOS.\n\n"],[2719,"We introduced background audio "],[2721,"playback in watchOS 5 for local "],[2723,"files. "],[2724,"And now in watchOS 6, we've "],[2726,"brought three ways to stream "],[2727,"audio directly to Apple Watch by "],[2729,"making Network, framework, "],[2731,"NSURLsessionStreamTask, and even "],[2733,"more of AVFoundation available "],[2735,"to you.\n\n"],[2736,"We also recognize that there are "],[2738,"use cases beyond audio playback, "],[2739,"workouts and navigation where "],[2741,"you need to keep your app "],[2743,"running order to complete a "],[2744,"task. "],[2745,"For example, a meditation "],[2746,"session. "],[2747,"In watchOS 6, we're introducing "],[2749,"a new extended runtime API that "],[2751,"gives more apps a way to stay "],[2753,"running even after the user "],[2754,"lowers their wrist.\n\n"],[2756,"This enables new app experiences "],[2758,"in self-care, mindfulness, "],[2761,"physical therapy, smart alarms "],[2763,"and health monitoring. "],[2765,"That's a lot of new APIs and "],[2767,"capabilities. "],[2768,"If only you had more options for "],[2770,"creating a compelling user "],[2771,"interface, right? "],[2773,"We know you've been asking for a "],[2775,"more advanced UI framework on "],[2777,"the watch for years. "],[2778,"And in watchOS 6 we finally have "],[2780,"one with SwiftUI.\n\n"],[2788,"You've already seen SwiftUI on "],[2789,"iOS. "],[2790,"That same declarative language "],[2791,"for defining beautiful user "],[2793,"interfaces is available for "],[2794,"watchOS as well, expanding "],[2796,"what's possible on the platform.\n\n"],[2798,"From lists with swipe to delete, "],[2800,"reordering and carousel filing, "],[2803,"to direct access, the digital "],[2804,"crown, it's easier than ever to "],[2806,"create a compelling watch "],[2807,"experience.\n\n"],[2810,"Let me show you how to start "],[2811,"making use of some of the new "],[2812,"independent app features with "],[2814,"SwiftUI.\n\n"],[2826,"Okay, so I've got my travel app "],[2827,"running here in the Simulator "],[2828,"and I've already started "],[2829,"updating it using SwiftUI, so "],[2831,"it's starting to look great. "],[2833,"But I still have some work to do "],[2834,"beyond layout because my Sign In "],[2836,"button currently just asks users "],[2837,"to sign in on iPhone. "],[2839,"And my users have told me that "],[2840,"is not what they want. "],[2841,"They want to be able to do everything right on their wrist. "],[2843,"So I'm going to quit the "],[2844,"simulator and go over to my "],[2845,"project file. "],[2847,"And I'll move to my travel watch "],[2848,"extension target and declare "],[2850,"independence from phone by "],[2852,"checking the Supports Running "],[2853,"Without iOS App Installation "],[2855,"box.\n\n"],[2857,"Next I'm going to go to the Sign "],[2858,"In view that I've already "],[2859,"started. "],[2860,"I'll resume my previews.\n\n"],[2862,"Great. And you can see I have a "],[2863,"Sign In button here and two "],[2864,"previews. "],[2865,"The top one is for English which "],[2867,"is the language that I speak and "],[2868,"the bottom one I'm starting to "],[2870,"experiment with localizing my "],[2871,"app into Arabic which is a "],[2872,"right-to-left language.\n\n"],[2874,"So the first thing I'm going to "],[2875,"do is add a field for my "],[2876,"Username button. "],[2878,"And I'm going to bind this to my "],[2880,"-- oops.\n\n"],[2883,"To my username state so that the "],[2884,"field updates as the value "],[2886,"changes. "],[2887,"Notice I've set the placeholder "],[2888,"text to username so I give the "],[2890,"user a chance to figure out what "],[2891,"to do with this field. "],[2892,"And I've also set the content "],[2893,"type to username so that "],[2895,"password and username autofill "],[2897,"works when using continuity "],[2899,"keyboard.\n\n"],[2900,"Next I'm going to add a password "],[2901,"field, and for this I want to "],[2903,"use a secure field so that "],[2904,"people can't spy on me when I'm "],[2907,"typing my password. "],[2908,"And again, I'm going to bind this to my password state.\n\n"],[2911,"I've got a password placeholder "],[2914,"text and again I'm using the "],[2915,"content type of Password for "],[2917,"autofill purposes. So that looks great in both "],[2919,"English and Arabic. "],[2920,"And for Arabic it's pulling the "],[2921,"strings right out of my "],[2922,"localizable strings file. "],[2923,"This is not placeholder content.\n\n"],[2926,"Okay. Above this, what I want to "],[2928,"do is add a Sign In With Apple "],[2930,"button because I think that's "],[2931,"how users are really going to "],[2932,"want to sign in.\n\n"],[2934,"So now I put that right at the "],[2935,"top and then add a separator so "],[2937,"it's clear that users have an "],[2938,"option of signing in with their "],[2939,"Apple ID or creating a customer "],[2941,"username and password for my "],[2943,"app. That looks great.\n\n"],[2945,"So the last step is to go over "],[2946,"to my hosting controller and "],[2948,"change my destination for my "],[2950,"presentation button to the Sign "],[2953,"In view that I just created "],[2954,"instead of the Sign In on iPhone "],[2956,"view. So I got that going and now I "],[2959,"want to turn on Live Preview, so "],[2960,"all my buttons become "],[2961,"interactive. "],[2962,"And then when I click on my Sign "],[2964,"In button, I get my form. "],[2966,"Sign In With Apple, or sign in "],[2968,"with a username and password. "],[2969,"That looks great. "],[2971,"And that is creating a sign-in "],[2972,"form on the Apple Watch with "],[2973,"SwiftUI.\n\n"],[2982,"Okay. So you've got the tools to "],[2983,"build a great independent Apple "],[2985,"Watch experience. "],[2986,"How are you going to get your "],[2987,"app in front of customers with "],[2991,"the least friction possible? "],[2994,"The App Store and Apple Watch "],[2995,"will be highlighting great "],[2996,"independent apps through curated "],[2998,"collections and editorial "],[2999,"selections at the top level of "],[3000,"the App Store. "],[3002,"We're emphasizing independent "],[3003,"apps here so users can get the "],[3005,"instant gratification of being "],[3006,"able to download and start using "],[3008,"your awesome apps right away, "],[3010,"whether they have the phone with "],[3011,"them or not.\n\n"],[3015,"And when you dive into individual product pages, you'll "],[3017,"see that this isn't just a pared "],[3018,"down experience. "],[3019,"Users will see full featured app "],[3021,"descriptions, screenshots, "],[3022,"reviews and more.\n\n"],[3025,"They can search for apps with "],[3026,"dictation or scribble.\n\n"],[3028,"And they'll be able to download "],[3030,"your apps directly to their "],[3032,"wrists, thanks to app and asset "],[3034,"thinning which make it possible "],[3035,"to deliver a small bundle with "],[3037,"only the architecture and assets "],[3039,"that makes sense for the current "],[3040,"watch. "],[3042,"If you have both an iOS and a "],[3043,"watchOS app, this will make your "],[3045,"iOS app smaller too, as we're no "],[3047,"longer downloading the watch "],[3048,"bundle to the phone and then "],[3050,"shuttling it over.\n\n"],[3052,"This is truly a whole new era "],[3053,"for Apple Watch apps to be more "],[3055,"functional, more beautiful and "],[3057,"more independent than ever. "],[3059,"We think both you and your "],[3060,"customers are going to love "],[3061,"this.\n\n"],[3063,"And now to talk about the "],[3064,"platform that we just declared "],[3065,"independence from, I'd like to "],[3067,"welcome Cindy to the stage.\n\n"],[3076,"Thank you, Lori. "],[3077,"iOS 13 is a big release.\n\n"],[3081,"You saw this morning that we "],[3082,"have a ton of new features and "],[3084,"enhancements like a redesigned "],[3086,"share sheet, a Quick Type "],[3088,"keyboard and a brand-new CarPlay "],[3090,"experience.\n\n"],[3092,"In addition to all of that, we "],[3094,"took a good long look at our UI "],[3096,"and gave iOS 13 a brand new "],[3098,"look.\n\n"],[3099,"This new look includes Dark "],[3101,"Mode, cards, contextual actions "],[3104,"and symbols.\n\n"],[3106,"Let's dive into the incredibly "],[3107,"cool new Dark Mode.\n\n"],[3110,"Dark mode keeps the brightness "],[3111,"down and gets Chrome out of the "],[3113,"way so you can focus on just "],[3115,"content. "],[3116,"The entire system has been "],[3118,"really thoughtfully updated and "],[3119,"refined to look amazing. "],[3120,"Your users are definitely going "],[3123,"to want this. "],[3124,"And to help you bring these same "],[3125,"refinements to your apps, we've "],[3128,"created some new APIs designed "],[3130,"specifically with Dark Mode in "],[3131,"mind.\n\n"],[3133,"But first it's semantic colors.\n\n"],[3136,"There are new colors for "],[3137,"backgrounds, fills and text. "],[3140,"And in Dark Mode, they have "],[3141,"multiple variants to give your "],[3143,"app a visual hierarchy. "],[3145,"Now what does that mean? "],[3147,"Well, when your app is "],[3148,"full-screen, its background is "],[3150,"pure black. "],[3151,"To ensure sufficient contrast, "],[3154,"UI presented above it takes on a "],[3156,"brighter color palette. "],[3158,"When multitasking on iPad, the "],[3160,"slide-over app and side-by-side "],[3162,"apps also render in these "],[3163,"lighter layer colors.\n\n"],[3166,"There is a lot of nuance to this "],[3167,"design, but you'll get it "],[3169,"automatically with semantic "],[3170,"colors.\n\n"],[3172,"And for when you need a pop, "],[3174,"there's a bright palette of "],[3175,"system colors that all have "],[3176,"variants for the increased "],[3178,"contrast accessibility mode as "],[3180,"well variants for Dark Mode.\n\n"],[3185,"There's also a brand-new set of "],[3187,"materials and vibrant content "],[3189,"filters with varying levels of "],[3190,"transparency so you can create "],[3192,"UI that looks great over any "],[3194,"content. "],[3195,"And just like semantic colors, "],[3197,"these materials support both "],[3199,"light and dark variants. "],[3201,"And they will automatically "],[3203,"update based on changes to the "],[3205,"UI Kit trait collection.\n\n"],[3207,"Adopting semantic colors and "],[3209,"adaptive materials will help you "],[3210,"provide a unified look that "],[3212,"automatically adapts to your "],[3213,"environment.\n\n"],[3216,"Another component of iOS 13's "],[3218,"new look is cards.\n\n"],[3221,"Since the original SDK, the "],[3223,"default presentation style on "],[3225,"iPhone has covered the full "],[3226,"screen. "],[3227,"We're changing that default to a "],[3229,"much more fluid card "],[3230,"presentation.\n\n"],[3232,"Cards provide a visual stack so "],[3234,"you can see at a glance that "],[3235,"you're in a presentation. "],[3236,"And even better, they're "],[3238,"dismissible with just a single "],[3239,"downward swipe.\n\n"],[3245,"Yeah. Swiping. "],[3248,"We've also updated the Peek and "],[3250,"Pop experience. "],[3252,"It's now quicker and easier to "],[3254,"access contextual actions "],[3255,"throughout the system. "],[3257,"And they're backed by a "],[3258,"brand-new API designed to work "],[3260,"across all devices. "],[3261,"So not only are they better than "],[3262,"ever on iPhone, but they look "],[3264,"great on iPad as well.\n\n"],[3266,"And when you bring your iPad app "],[3268,"to macOS, they'll look great "],[3269,"there too.\n\n"],[3277,"Yeah. While we were going "],[3278,"through the system, making all "],[3279,"those thoughtful refinements, we "],[3281,"started thinking about symbols.\n\n"],[3284,"Most apps use symbols. "],[3286,"They are a really useful way to "],[3287,"convey information. "],[3288,"And symbols are very often used "],[3290,"with text. "],[3291,"But text has some great "],[3293,"properties that in iOS 12 our "],[3294,"symbols just didn't have.\n\n"],[3297,"So as you can see here, the text "],[3299,"is scaling nicely as the dynamic "],[3301,"type size increases, but the "],[3303,"symbols stayed the same. "],[3305,"Ideally, we'd want the symbols "],[3306,"to scale along with the text.\n\n"],[3309,"So we created SF Symbols.\n\n"],[3312,"SF Symbols have all the "],[3313,"expressiveness and behavior of a "],[3315,"font but packaged up as a UI "],[3317,"image so they're really easy to "],[3319,"use in your apps. "],[3320,"iOS 13 includes an absolutely "],[3323,"massive catalog of over 1,500 SF "],[3326,"Symbols for you to use. "],[3327,"And they're easily searchable "],[3329,"right within Xcode and using "],[3331,"standalone SF Symbols app on "],[3333,"your Mac.\n\n"],[3343,"Symbols.  So now you can "],[3345,"see the symbols scale along with "],[3347,"the text for better legibility "],[3349,"and a more consistent layout at "],[3351,"larger sizes. And because they behave just "],[3354,"like a font, they're available "],[3356,"in all of these weights as well.\n\n"],[3364,"All of this just scratches the "],[3365,"surface of what's available in "],[3366,"iOS 13. "],[3368,"There's a new share sheet API to "],[3369,"let apps have recipient "],[3371,"suggestions. A new compositional layout API "],[3373,"to make collection views easier "],[3375,"to work with than ever. And a screenshot enhancement so "],[3378,"apps can provide full page views "],[3379,"of long content. "],[3381,"And so much more.\n\n"],[3384,"And in addition to all of that, "],[3387,"we really wanted to bring iOS "],[3389,"forward this year.\n\n"],[3391,"So we gave it its own operating "],[3392,"system complete with major "],[3394,"enhancements to multitasking, a "],[3396,"new PencilKit framework and a "],[3398,"whole suite of productivity "],[3399,"gestures.\n\n"],[3402,"Let's start with multitasking.\n\n"],[3405,"At iPadOS, your app can be open "],[3407,"in multiple spaces at the same "],[3409,"time, as well as in the "],[3411,"slide-over stack, and display "],[3412,"different content in each space.\n\n"],[3416,"To enable this, we're "],[3417,"introducing a new UI window "],[3419,"scene API.\n\n"],[3421,"Each window scene represents a "],[3422,"single instance of your app's "],[3424,"UI.\n\n"],[3426,"Prior to iPadOS, your app "],[3428,"delegate was responsible for "],[3429,"both its process and UI "],[3431,"lifecycle.\n\n"],[3433,"With window scene, we're "],[3434,"splitting out the UI portion of "],[3435,"that into a new scene delegate "],[3437,"object so it can be managed "],[3439,"independently. "],[3441,"And since they're completely "],[3442,"independent, your app can now "],[3443,"manage multiple at the same "],[3446,"time. "],[3447,"Your users can even use drag and "],[3450,"drop to allow individual items "],[3452,"from your apps such as a single "],[3453,"window or message to be opened "],[3455,"in a brand-new window scene.\n\n"],[3458,"With this new capability, it's "],[3460,"really important that your users "],[3462,"can resume whatever they were "],[3463,"doing in any scene at any time. "],[3466,"To make this easy, we've built a "],[3468,"new state restoration system "],[3469,"based on NSUserActivity.\n\n"],[3472,"You're probably already familiar "],[3474,"with this versatile API. "],[3475,"It's used for handoff, search, "],[3477,"indexing, Siri, and now for "],[3480,"window scene state restoration.\n\n"],[3486,"One of the things that really "],[3487,"sets -- you can clap, it's fine.\n\n"],[3496,"One of the things that really sets iPads apart is Apple "],[3498,"Pencil.\n\n"],[3500,"We're introducing PencilKit "],[3501,"which allows you to easily add "],[3503,"smooth low-latency drawing to "],[3504,"your apps. "],[3506,"This is the same engine used in "],[3508,"Apple apps like Notes, Markup "],[3510,"and Screenshots. "],[3511,"So you get all of those same "],[3513,"features and tools right in your "],[3516,"apps. You can even use the canvas and "],[3518,"palette functionality separately "],[3520,"and just pick and choose which "],[3521,"pieces make sense for your use "],[3524,"case. "],[3525,"Finally, let's talk about "],[3527,"productivity gestures.\n\n"],[3530,"We've made text selection much "],[3531,"easier. "],[3532,"You can now just drag your "],[3533,"finger along text to select it. "],[3536,"Text views and web views are "],[3537,"automatically updated with this "],[3539,"new selection gesture.\n\n"],[3543,"And there are new three-finger "],[3544,"gestures for undo and redo.\n\n"],[3547,"Swipe three fingers left for "],[3548,"undo and right for redo. "],[3550,"These new gestures use the "],[3551,"existing NSUndoManager so you "],[3553,"don't have to do anything at all "],[3554,"to adopt.\n\n"],[3559,"If you'd like easy text "],[3560,"selection outside of text or web "],[3561,"views, or if your app already "],[3563,"uses three-finger gestures and "],[3565,"you have a conflict, you can use "],[3566,"the UITexInteraction API to fix "],[3569,"up those issues.\n\n"],[3572,"And for scroll views, you can "],[3573,"now drag the scroll indicator to "],[3575,"jump directly to a location in "],[3576,"the scroll view.\n\n"],[3578,"To enable this behavior, just "],[3580,"turn on Show Scroll Indicators. "],[3582,"For this one it's really "],[3583,"important that your scrolling is "],[3584,"performant as we might have to "],[3586,"load all of the cells in a frame "],[3588,"at the same time. "],[3590,"We think our users are going to "],[3592,"love the powerful new things "],[3593,"iPadOS gives them, and we cannot "],[3596,"wait to see what you do with it. "],[3598,"So I'd like to welcome Sebastien "],[3599,"back to the stage.\n\n"],[3607,"Thank you, Cindy. "],[3608,"Now as you've seen, each of our "],[3610,"platforms has incredible new "],[3611,"features that refine the "],[3613,"experience that each offers and "],[3614,"gives them great new "],[3615,"capabilities. "],[3616,"And across all of our platforms "],[3618,"we build a range of technologies "],[3620,"that are designed to give your "],[3621,"apps a huge head start so that "],[3623,"you can build the latest "],[3624,"technologies right into your "],[3626,"app. "],[3628,"There are a few of these that we'd like to focus on this "],[3629,"afternoon and they cover a "],[3631,"pretty wide range of "],[3632,"capabilities from how we open "],[3634,"our platforms and apps to all "],[3636,"users to how we combine the "],[3637,"virtual and real-world with "],[3639,"augmented reality. "],[3640,"And so we start with "],[3641,"accessibility, and to do that "],[3643,"I'd like to welcome Eric Seymour "],[3644,"on stage. "],[3645,"Eric? "],[3649,"Thank you, Sebastien.\n\n"],[3652,"So we all know that technology "],[3654,"plays a powerful role in "],[3655,"people's lives. But this is especially true for "],[3659,"people with disabilities. "],[3661,"Technology can be instrumental "],[3663,"in fostering independence, "],[3664,"employment and empowerment. "],[3666,"At Apple, we're guided by a few "],[3668,"key principles for accessibility "],[3669,"and it begins with accessibility "],[3671,"being built in. "],[3672,"People should be able to use our "],[3674,"products out of the box, and "],[3675,"that includes people of all "],[3677,"abilities.\n\n"],[3679,"Accessibility should be "],[3680,"comprehensive. "],[3681,"People should have access to the "],[3683,"whole platform, every corner of "],[3685,"the OS, every corner of your "],[3686,"apps. "],[3688,"And perhaps most important, we "],[3690,"want to surprise and delight all "],[3692,"users regardless of ability. "],[3694,"And so this is more than just "],[3695,"about fixing accessibility bugs. "],[3697,"This is about using your "],[3699,"features with accessibility and "],[3701,"striving for an experience "],[3702,"that's great, that's just as "],[3703,"inspired as your original "],[3704,"design. "],[3705,"When we think about "],[3709,"accessibility, we're really "],[3711,"talking about a broad continuum "],[3713,"of abilities. "],[3714,"Hearing, vision, physical, "],[3716,"learning. "],[3717,"And within each of these areas, "],[3719,"we're focused on different "],[3720,"conditions. "],[3722,"So for example, for vision, we "],[3723,"of course have Voiceover, our "],[3725,"screen reader for people who "],[3726,"can't see the screen. "],[3727,"But we also have over a dozen "],[3731,"vision-related features from "],[3733,"zoom to large text. "],[3735,"And when we take this approach "],[3737,"and we apply it to that broad "],[3738,"continuum of abilities, we're "],[3740,"talking about dozens of "],[3742,"accessibility features. "],[3743,"And it really underscores the "],[3744,"notion that accessibility is for "],[3748,"everyone.\n\n"],[3750,"Probably most of you use at "],[3752,"least one accessibility feature. "],[3753,"And if you don't already, "],[3755,"there's a good chance you will "],[3756,"eventually. "],[3757,"This year we're introducing "],[3760,"several new accessibility "],[3762,"features and enhancements, and "],[3763,"today I'm going to talk about "],[3764,"two, starting with "],[3766,"discoverability. "],[3768,"In the spirit of accessibility "],[3769,"being for everyone, we wanted to "],[3771,"make it easier to find. "],[3772,"And so to that end we've added "],[3775,"accessibility to iOS Quick "],[3776,"Start, making the out-of-box "],[3778,"experience even more accessible. "],[3781,"Also we've moved accessibility "],[3784,"to the top level of settings.\n\n"],[3793,"And we've reorganized it to make "],[3794,"things easier to find. "],[3796,"We think it's going to go a long "],[3797,"way to help people discover and "],[3798,"use these great features. "],[3799,"Now let's talk about voice "],[3803,"control, right? "],[3804,"We saw this this morning during "],[3805,"the keynote. "],[3806,"Voice control is this full voice "],[3807,"experience from macOS, iOS and "],[3809,"iPadOS and we think it's going "],[3811,"to be really helpful for people "],[3813,"with physical challenges. "],[3815,"Voice control provides "],[3816,"comprehensive platform access. "],[3818,"You can speak to items by name. "],[3820,"You can refer to items by "],[3821,"number. "],[3822,"You can even speak to regions of "],[3823,"the screen using a grid. "],[3826,"Voice control has got great text "],[3828,"editing. So of course I can dictate text "],[3830,"but I can also make selections "],[3831,"and corrections using only my "],[3833,"voice. "],[3834,"And it also has awareness. "],[3837,"So effectively even when I'm "],[3839,"dictating text, it hears "],[3840,"commands and it doesn't make me "],[3842,"manage that distinction. "],[3843,"I can just talk to it. "],[3845,"And using the true depth camera, "],[3846,"if I look away, it knows that it "],[3848,"can ignore me.\n\n"],[3850,"Voice control's got great spoken "],[3852,"gestures so of course I can do "],[3853,"simple things like taps and "],[3855,"swipes. But I can also pre-record more "],[3857,"complex gestures that I might "],[3859,"want to use in an app or a game, "],[3860,"like this rotate gesture.\n\n"],[3863,"And of course voice control "],[3865,"speech recognition runs fully on "],[3867,"device. "],[3868,"And so now I'd like to show you "],[3870,"voice control in action.\n\n"],[3878,"And for this demo I'm going to "],[3879,"be talking to my iPhone.\n\n"],[3887,"Open messages. "],[3889,"Hey Chris, let's grab dinner "],[3894,"tonight. "],[3896,"I'm thinking pizza. "],[3898,"Pizza emoji.\n\n"],[3900,"Change tonight to this weekend.\n\n"],[3904,"Tap send.\n\n"],[3909,"Undo that.\n\n"],[3911,"Tap send.\n\n"],[3916,"Undo that.\n\n"],[3920,"Tap send.\n\n"],[3926,"Open Maps.\n\n"],[3930,"Tap search field. "],[3931,"San Pedro Square.\n\n"],[3936,"Show numbers.\n\n"],[3939,"Five. Show grid continuously. "],[3944,"15. Zoom at one. "],[3949,"Repeat four times.\n\n"],[3963,"Swipe up at 27. "],[3965,"Hide grid.\n\n"],[3968,"Tap share. "],[3969,"Tap Chris Adams. "],[3973,"Lots of options around here, "],[3977,"period. "],[3978,"See you later. "],[3981,"Peace emoji.\n\n"],[3984,"Ah, look at that. "],[3987,"Undo that.\n\n"],[3990,"Peace emoji. "],[3991,"Tap send.\n\n"],[4000,"Undo that.\n\n"],[4003,"Tap send.\n\n"],[4014,"Go home. Go to sleep.\n\n"],[4016,"Okay. So that's voice control.\n\n"],[4020,"Now -- "],[4026,"Now we can also use voice "],[4027,"control as developers to test "],[4029,"the accessibility of our apps. "],[4031,"And so let's do that now with "],[4032,"the travel app that you saw "],[4033,"earlier. "],[4034,"Wake up. Open Travel.\n\n"],[4041,"Tap San Francisco. "],[4043,"Tap San Francisco. "],[4046,"Show names.\n\n"],[4048,"All right, here's the problem. "],[4053,"So I'm trying to tap on San "],[4055,"Francisco, this element, but it "],[4057,"doesn't have a good "],[4058,"accessibility label yet and it's "],[4059,"a really common problem. "],[4060,"It means I can't speak to this "],[4061,"element with voice control, and "],[4063,"even worse, if I couldn't see "],[4064,"the screen and Voiceover were "],[4066,"reading this to me, I'd be "],[4068,"completely out of luck, stopped "],[4069,"in my tracks. "],[4070,"I would not be able to use this "],[4071,"app. "],[4072,"So fortunately these things are "],[4075,"pretty easy to fix. "],[4076,"And so let's talk about what you "],[4077,"can do to make your apps more "],[4079,"accessible.\n\n"],[4084,"The good news is, most "],[4085,"accessibility features just "],[4087,"work. "],[4088,"But some of them, indeed the "],[4089,"most transformative features "],[4090,"like Voice Control and Switch "],[4091,"Control and Voiceover, they need "],[4094,"your support. And so here's what you can do. "],[4096,"First, do what we just did. "],[4098,"Just try it. "],[4099,"Use your apps with accessibility "],[4101,"features. "],[4102,"You might actually be surprised "],[4103,"at what already works. "],[4104,"But more importantly, you're "],[4105,"going to gain valuable insight "],[4107,"into how some users actually "],[4110,"experience your app. "],[4111,"And you're probably going to "],[4112,"want to make some changes. "],[4114,"Next, use the tools. "],[4117,"Xcode's got great built-in "],[4118,"accessibility support for "],[4119,"developers. "],[4120,"You can edit accessibility "],[4121,"properties right in the Xcode "],[4123,"inspector. "],[4124,"And with new Environment "],[4125,"Overrides, you can preview "],[4127,"visual accessibility "],[4128,"accommodations during your "],[4129,"development lifecycle right in "],[4131,"your app. "],[4132,"It's really cool. "],[4134,"Finally, implement the "],[4136,"Accessibility API. "],[4137,"It's the best way to ensure an "],[4139,"accessible experience. "],[4141,"It's the essential way. "],[4142,"Doing this well is like putting "],[4144,"out a welcome mat to your app "],[4146,"for users of all abilities. "],[4148,"It's how Voiceover and Switch "],[4149,"Control and the rest talk to "],[4151,"your app to offer an adapted "],[4152,"experience. "],[4154,"The Accessibility APIs work on "],[4155,"all platform, and while they're "],[4157,"easy to implement, they're super "],[4158,"powerful. "],[4159,"So even the most sophisticated "],[4160,"apps and experiences can be made "],[4162,"fully accessible. "],[4164,"And of course, SwiftUI has great "],[4166,"accessibility support built "],[4168,"right in. "],[4169,"And so that's our accessibility "],[4171,"update today. "],[4172,"Now another thing we care deeply "],[4174,"about at Apple is privacy. "],[4175,"And so to tell you more about "],[4177,"that, I'd like to hand things "],[4178,"over to Katie. "],[4179,"Thanks very much.\n\n"],[4187,"Thanks, Eric. "],[4188,"Privacy is a topic that isn't "],[4190,"going away. "],[4191,"And it's something that everyone "],[4192,"needs to pay attention to. "],[4193,"It's something you have to "],[4196,"design in from the beginning and "],[4199,"it shapes how your product "],[4200,"works.\n\n"],[4202,"When you're designing a new "],[4203,"feature, here are a few steps "],[4205,"that you can take to design for "],[4207,"privacy.\n\n"],[4209,"Process on the user's device. "],[4212,"Wherever you can keep user data "],[4214,"on-device, do it. "],[4216,"And this helps you to collect as "],[4219,"little data as you can. "],[4221,"If you don't have the data, it "],[4223,"can't be abused or stolen. "],[4226,"Ask first. "],[4227,"Ask permission from your user "],[4232,"for the data and how you plan to "],[4234,"use it. "],[4235,"And if you do collect data, use "],[4238,"random identifiers. "],[4239,"And scope them down from an "],[4241,"account to a device, to a "],[4244,"session where possible. "],[4246,"And encrypt to keep your users' "],[4249,"data secure.\n\n"],[4251,"Applying these principles in "],[4253,"your design process will help "],[4255,"you build great features and "],[4257,"great privacy. "],[4258,"I want to talk about two areas "],[4261,"where we've made it easier for "],[4264,"you to take these steps. "],[4266,"First, location.\n\n"],[4270,"Where you go can reveal a lot "],[4272,"about your life. "],[4274,"Where you live, where you work, "],[4277,"what doctor's office you might "],[4278,"go to, or how often you're "],[4281,"hitting the gym versus maybe the "],[4283,"bar.\n\n"],[4285,"Because of this, some users are "],[4287,"hesitant to share location with "],[4289,"you and your apps. "],[4291,"So they might miss out on some "],[4293,"of your key features. "],[4295,"So this year, we're adding a new "],[4297,"option: Allow Once.\n\n"],[4301,"This provides location access "],[4303,"for just that session and will "],[4305,"ask the user again next time. "],[4309,"But let's say your app is even "],[4311,"better with Always Allow "],[4313,"Location permission. "],[4315,"Here's how this will now work.\n\n"],[4318,"First the user needs to select "],[4320,"While In Use.\n\n"],[4322,"Then you request location while "],[4325,"your app is in the background.\n\n"],[4327,"Then the user will be presented "],[4329,"with an alert, letting them know "],[4331,"that you're requesting location "],[4333,"in the background. "],[4336,"If they change to Always Allow, "],[4339,"you'll have background location "],[4340,"access moving forward. "],[4342,"Finally, we're giving users more "],[4346,"transparency into how their "],[4348,"location is being accessed.\n\n"],[4350,"For all apps with background "],[4352,"location permission, from time "],[4354,"to time we'll show them where "],[4356,"your app accessed their "],[4357,"location.\n\n"],[4368,"With these changes to permissions, users will feel "],[4370,"more comfortable in how they're "],[4372,"sharing location with you.\n\n"],[4375,"Now, let's talk about login.\n\n"],[4380,"We've all seen or maybe "],[4381,"implemented buttons like these. "],[4383,"And they can be really "],[4385,"convenient, but they can come at "],[4387,"the cost of your user's privacy.\n\n"],[4390,"They also might share more "],[4391,"information about your company's "],[4394,"business than you really want to "],[4396,"be disclosing.\n\n"],[4398,"So we want to offer a better "],[4400,"option. And it's called Sign In With "],[4403,"Apple.\n\n"],[4411,"It offers fast, easy sign-in "],[4413,"without all the tracking. "],[4415,"This isn't just about privacy "],[4417,"for our users, but also for your "],[4420,"company.\n\n"],[4422,"It's not our business to know "],[4424,"how users engage with your app, "],[4426,"so Apple simply won't track "],[4429,"that.\n\n"],[4437,"It's easy to add a Sign In With "],[4438,"Apple button to your app with a "],[4440,"simple API.\n\n"],[4441,"Users can set up an account and "],[4444,"sign into your app with a tap "],[4446,"and a quick Face ID. "],[4449,"So why is this great for all of "],[4453,"you? First off, more trust and less "],[4455,"friction equals more engaged "],[4458,"users.\n\n"],[4459,"Sign In With Apple can shorten "],[4461,"the distance between a user "],[4464,"considering your application and "],[4467,"really embracing it.\n\n"],[4471,"Second, verify email addresses.\n\n"],[4474,"Apple has already done the work "],[4477,"of verifying email addresses for "],[4479,"you.\n\n"],[4488,"And we're removing the incentive "],[4489,"for users to share made-up email "],[4491,"addresses by offering a private "],[4494,"email relay service. "],[4495,"So even if a user chooses to "],[4499,"hide their email address when "],[4501,"setting up an account, your "],[4503,"email will arrive in their "],[4504,"verified account, their verified "],[4507,"inbox. "],[4508,"And then there's security. "],[4512,"With Sign Into Apple, you don't "],[4514,"need to deal with storing "],[4515,"passwords or password reset "],[4518,"issues. "],[4519,"And every single account is "],[4521,"protected with two-factor "],[4523,"authentication.\n\n"],[4532,"This can really improve your "],[4533,"security.\n\n"],[4535,"We've also integrated some "],[4536,"interesting innovations around "],[4540,"anti-fraud. "],[4542,"We all know that along with some "],[4544,"real users, sometimes you get "],[4546,"some not so real users.\n\n"],[4549,"Nobody wants bots or farmed "],[4551,"accounts. "],[4552,"And we work hard to filter them "],[4554,"out of our systems. "],[4556,"And we want to help you do the "],[4558,"same. "],[4559,"So we built what we call a real "],[4563,"user indicator. "],[4564,"It can tell you if an incoming "],[4566,"account is a real user or if you "],[4569,"might want to do some additional "],[4571,"verification.\n\n"],[4573,"So how does this work? "],[4576,"First off, the whole system is "],[4577,"built from the ground up to "],[4579,"maintain user privacy. "],[4581,"It uses on-device intelligence "],[4584,"to determine if the originating "],[4586,"device is behaving in a normal "],[4589,"way. "],[4590,"The device generates a value "],[4592,"without sharing any specifics "],[4593,"with Apple.\n\n"],[4596,"This is combined with select "],[4598,"account information and then "],[4599,"boiled down into a single value "],[4602,"that's shared with your app at "],[4606,"account setup time. "],[4608,"Then depending on the value that "],[4609,"you receive, you can be "],[4610,"confident that your new user is "],[4612,"a real user or get a signal that "],[4615,"you might want to take a second "],[4616,"look.\n\n"],[4620,"And all of this comes with great "],[4621,"cross-platform support. "],[4623,"It's available on iOS, iPadOS, "],[4625,"macOS, watchOS, tvOS and it even "],[4632,"works on the web.\n\n"],[4634,"So it can work on Android and "],[4636,"Windows devices.\n\n"],[4647,"So there you go.\n\n"],[4649,"A super-fast and easy way to "],[4651,"engage new users, two-factor "],[4653,"authentication and anti-fraud "],[4656,"built in. "],[4658,"You can implement it virtually "],[4659,"anywhere, and most importantly, "],[4662,"it respects everyone's privacy.\n\n"],[4666,"So this is a solution both you "],[4668,"and your users can trust.\n\n"],[4676,"We've already had a number of "],[4677,"developers working with us and "],[4679,"we're excited to see many more "],[4681,"of you adopt. "],[4682,"So that's Sign In With Apple.\n\n"],[4696,"As I mentioned earlier, a great "],[4698,"way to preserve user privacy is "],[4700,"to work with the users' data "],[4701,"on-device. "],[4702,"And we've built some great "],[4704,"technologies for doing just "],[4708,"that. To tell you more about machine "],[4710,"learning, I'd like to hand it "],[4711,"over to Bill.\n\n"],[4717,"Thank you, Katie.\n\n"],[4721,"Machine learning is a key "],[4722,"technology for so many of the "],[4724,"experiences in your apps. "],[4726,"And at Apple, we use on-device "],[4728,"machine learning to power "],[4730,"features from stunning camera "],[4732,"and photos capabilities to ARKit "],[4734,"and more. "],[4735,"And we can do this because of "],[4737,"our cutting-edge silicon.\n\n"],[4740,"With powerful CPUs, GPUs and "],[4741,"dedicated ML processors like the "],[4744,"Neural Engine, we can deliver "],[4746,"incredible real-time "],[4748,"experiences.\n\n"],[4750,"The Neural Engine is optimized "],[4752,"to accelerate convolutional "],[4753,"neural networks with "],[4754,"multi-precision support and a "],[4756,"Smart Compute system.\n\n"],[4759,"What does that mean? "],[4761,"It means it's an absolute beast. "],[4764,"In fact, the Neural Engine is "],[4767,"capable of up to 5 trillion "],[4769,"operations per second. "],[4771,"Best of all, we've built our "],[4773,"machine learning APIs on top of "],[4775,"this so that your apps can take "],[4778,"full advantage of this blazing "],[4780,"performance.\n\n"],[4781,"And we have some great updates, "],[4783,"starting with our out-of-the-box "],[4785,"APIs like Vision, Natural "],[4787,"Language, and Speech.\n\n"],[4790,"Today these APIs deliver rich "],[4791,"features such as face detection, "],[4794,"object tracking and named entity "],[4796,"recognition. "],[4797,"And this year, we're adding even "],[4799,"more. "],[4800,"Let's have a look at a few of "],[4801,"these, starting with image "],[4803,"saliency which gives you a "],[4805,"heat map for an image, "],[4806,"highlighting important objects "],[4808,"and where users are likely to "],[4810,"focus their attention.\n\n"],[4812,"We use this today in photos to "],[4814,"help intelligently crop images "],[4816,"as part of the curation "],[4817,"experience. "],[4818,"We're also releasing text "],[4820,"recognition where you can search "],[4822,"text from images like posters, "],[4825,"signs and documents.\n\n"],[4834,"And take advantage of the "],[4835,"document camera capability we "],[4837,"use in Notes. "],[4838,"For Natural Language, you can "],[4840,"make use of word embeddings "],[4842,"which help to identify words or "],[4844,"sentences with similar meanings. "],[4847,"We use this today for search in "],[4849,"photos so that if you search for "],[4850,"an unknown term like musician, "],[4852,"we can suggest alternatives like "],[4854,"entertainer or singer.\n\n"],[4857,"And this year, our Speech API is "],[4859,"now on-device and works on "],[4862,"iPhone, iPad and Mac with "],[4864,"support for 10 languages.\n\n"],[4873,"And with features like Speech Saliency, you can understand the "],[4875,"pronunciation, pitch and the "],[4878,"cadence of speech.\n\n"],[4881,"Now for those of you who want to "],[4882,"go deeper with machine learning, "],[4884,"you can make use of Core ML, our "],[4886,"on-device technology designed to "],[4888,"run machine learning models with "],[4890,"high performance and privacy.\n\n"],[4894,"Today Core ML has great support "],[4896,"for many machine learning "],[4897,"models, from neural networks to "],[4899,"boosted trees and more. "],[4901,"But as you know, the field of "],[4902,"machine learning is constantly "],[4904,"evolving. "],[4905,"And so this year we set out to "],[4906,"support the most advanced neural "],[4908,"networks by adding more layer "],[4910,"types than ever before. "],[4912,"In fact, Core ML now supports "],[4915,"over 100 model layer types.\n\n"],[4919,"This enables you to run some of "],[4920,"the most cutting-edge machine "],[4921,"learning models on Apple "],[4923,"devices.\n\n"],[4924,"Models like ELMO or WaveNet or "],[4927,"some very recently published "],[4928,"ones like BERT, bringing "],[4931,"breakthrough natural language "],[4932,"processing to your apps.\n\n"],[4936,"Now running models like these in "],[4938,"your apps is only part of the "],[4939,"story. "],[4941,"There are times when you may "],[4942,"want to update the models in "],[4943,"your apps on-device based on "],[4946,"user data.\n\n"],[4947,"We do this today for features "],[4949,"like Face ID where a user's "],[4951,"appearance may be evolving over "],[4953,"time. They change their hair, wear a "],[4955,"hat. "],[4956,"Or for features like our Siri "],[4957,"Watch Face where the set of "],[4960,"recommendations is constantly "],[4961,"evolving to deliver a "],[4962,"personalized experience for each "],[4964,"user.

"],[4992,"With model personalization, your "],[4994,"apps can now update models in "],[4996,"the background without "],[4997,"compromising user privacy.\n\n"],[5000,"Core ML delivers the most "],[5002,"advanced platform for machine "],[5003,"learning models, and building "],[5005,"Core ML models has never been "],[5007,"easier with Create ML, our "],[5010,"framework designed to help all "],[5011,"of you build models with just a "],[5014,"few lines of code. "],[5016,"And this year we're taking Create ML even further. "],[5019,"It's now a macOS app that lets "],[5021,"you build models with zero code "],[5022,"right from your Mac.\n\n"],[5031,"You can choose from many different model templates to fit "],[5033,"your data. "],[5034,"You can build multiple models "],[5035,"with different datasets and "],[5037,"define the parameters for each "],[5039,"of them. "],[5040,"You get real-time feedback on "],[5042,"model training. "],[5044,"And Create ML supports transfer "],[5046,"learning for tasks like image "],[5047,"classification or text analysis. "],[5050,"This speeds up training since "],[5052,"you need very little data and "],[5053,"can leverage Apple's optimized "],[5055,"and heavily pre-trained models.\n\n"],[5058,"And you get to experiment and "],[5060,"preview the models. "],[5062,"So for example, you can get "],[5063,"predictions for images by using "],[5065,"your iPhone's camera with "],[5067,"continuity on your Mac. "],[5070,"Or you can use the microphone on "],[5071,"your Mac to test your sound "],[5073,"classification model.\n\n"],[5075,"So that's a ton of new stuff and "],[5077,"we're super excited to see what "],[5079,"you can do with all these "],[5080,"awesome new machine learning "],[5082,"capabilities. "],[5083,"In fact, we invited a few "],[5085,"developers to try out all the "],[5086,"new stuff and we've seen some "],[5087,"amazing results. "],[5090,"One in particular was so cool we "],[5093,"decided we had to share it with "],[5094,"you. "],[5095,"So please welcome Ben Harroway "],[5097,"from Lumen Digital to give you a "],[5099,"preview of his new app "],[5100,"NoisyBook.\n\n"],[5107,"Thanks, Bill. "],[5108,"Hi, everyone, I'm Ben from Lumen "],[5110,"Digital and I've been working on "],[5111,"a brand-new app, NoisyBook.\n\n"],[5118,"Let me tell you a story. "],[5121,"Once upon a time, on a beautiful "],[5124,"meadow lived a boy called Jack "],[5127,"and his cow Daisy. "],[5131,"Daisy.\n\n"],[5135,"A mysterious man gave them some "],[5137,"magic beans which grew into a "],[5139,"giant beanstalk, high into the "],[5141,"clouds.\n\n"],[5145,"Okay, I think everybody knows "],[5146,"this story. "],[5147,"Let's try something really "],[5148,"different.\n\n"],[5150,"Suddenly an exploding chicken "],[5155,"and his friend the golden tiger "],[5156,"jumped into their "],[5160,"helicopter  and flew "],[5164,"into the forest.\n\n"],[5168,"And of course, guess what? "],[5169,"They all lived happily ever "],[5172,"after.\n\n"],[5174,"Yay. "],[5175,"Can you make animal noises "],[5176,"you heard in the story? "],[5179,"Okay, we've had some fun. "],[5180,"Now NoisyBook wants us to repeat "],[5182,"some of the animal noises that "],[5183,"we heard during the story. "],[5185,"I think we heard a cow in this "],[5187,"story, so let's try this.\n\n"],[5189,"Moo. There he is. "],[5192,"I really cannot believe I'm "],[5194,"standing here making animal "],[5195,"noises in front of all of these "],[5197,"people. "],[5199,"Mad. But how amazing, the app "],[5201,"has used a sound classification "],[5203,"model to actually recognize that "],[5205,"noise and acknowledge it.\n\n"],[5208,"You likely also noticed "],[5210,"NoisyBook was able to work with "],[5211,"both traditional stories and "],[5213,"stories straight from our own "],[5215,"imaginations. "],[5216,"It's super powerful. "],[5218,"And thanks to the new features "],[5220,"of speech, sound and Core ML in "],[5222,"iOS 13 and Create ML, this is "],[5226,"all happening entirely "],[5228,"on-device. "],[5229,"It's all happening in real time "],[5231,"and it's running through a "],[5232,"natural language model that I've "],[5233,"trained on over 90,000 lines of "],[5236,"text. "],[5237,"And thanks to these features, "],[5240,"I've been able to take an idea "],[5241,"that I've struggled with for "],[5242,"around two years and really "],[5244,"implement some of these magical "],[5246,"new features in just a couple of "],[5247,"days.\n\n"],[5249,"I'm super proud of it and I do "],[5250,"hope that you'll remember to "],[5251,"check out NoisyBook when it "],[5253,"lands on the App Store later "],[5254,"this year. "],[5255,"Thank you.\n\n"],[5264,"Thanks, Ben. "],[5265,"That was really cool. "],[5266,"I know my kids are going to love "],[5269,"it. "],[5270,"Now one of the biggest uses of "],[5272,"machine learning at Apple is "],[5274,"Siri. "],[5275,"Siri is by far the world's most "],[5277,"popular intelligent assistant "],[5279,"with over 500 million monthly "],[5282,"active devices, making over 15 "],[5285,"billion requests. "],[5287,"These are staggering numbers. "],[5289,"And Siri works across all of "],[5291,"Apple's devices. "],[5293,"With Siri, your users can "],[5295,"interact with your apps in new "],[5297,"ways. "],[5298,"On the go, with Air Pods, "],[5300,"hands-free from across the room, "],[5302,"or even while in the car. "],[5305,"And thousands of apps are now "],[5307,"integrated with Siri through "],[5309,"Siri Shortcuts.\n\n"],[5311,"We built Siri Shortcuts to allow "],[5313,"you to expose the capabilities "],[5315,"you already have in your apps "],[5317,"with very little work and in a "],[5319,"discoverable way for your users.\n\n"],[5323,"You can make your shortcuts "],[5324,"discoverable using the Add to "],[5326,"Siri button, educating your "],[5328,"users on how they can use your "],[5329,"app with voice.\n\n"],[5331,"That matters because voice "],[5332,"functionality can otherwise be "],[5334,"really hard to discover. "],[5336,"And we've simplified setup so "],[5338,"that the user no longer needs to "],[5340,"record a phrase. "],[5341,"You suggest a phrase and they "],[5343,"add it with a tap.\n\n"],[5352,"And the biggest request we had this year was to support "],[5354,"parameters in Shortcuts. "],[5356,"So we've made Shortcuts "],[5360,"conversational which allows "],[5362,"users to interact with your app "],[5364,"through questions in Siri. "],[5367,"So for example, if I'm choosing "],[5368,"what to cook, I could run a "],[5369,"Shortcut with Pana, my recipes "],[5371,"app, and see a list of all my "],[5373,"favorites. "],[5374,"When I choose from the list, it "],[5376,"takes me to the recipe and "],[5377,"starts playing. "],[5379,"And this year the Shortcuts app "],[5382,"is built into iOS and iPadOS, "],[5386,"which means that every user will "],[5387,"have an opportunity to try it "],[5389,"out. And the app is now the home for "],[5392,"shortcuts from your apps too.\n\n"],[5395,"And by popular request, we're "],[5397,"adding support for automation.\n\n"],[5406,"Which allows users to set "],[5408,"specific triggers for when to "],[5409,"run any shortcut. "],[5412,"And there's plenty of options to "],[5413,"choose from. "],[5414,"You can trigger a shortcut based "],[5416,"on time of day, when you start a "],[5418,"workout on your Apple Watch, "],[5419,"when you connect to CarPlay and "],[5421,"many more.\n\n"],[5424,"And the editor now enables full "],[5426,"configuration of your app's "],[5427,"actions, including the ability "],[5429,"to pass information in or out of "],[5432,"your action through parameters. "],[5434,"With this, your app's actions "],[5436,"can be combined with actions "],[5438,"from other apps in multi-step "],[5439,"shortcuts.\n\n"],[5442,"Let's say you need to get dinner "],[5443,"for the family. "],[5444,"The kids are hungry, you need it "],[5446,"fast. "],[5447,"You could have a shortcut that "],[5448,"uses the Caviar app that lets "],[5450,"you choose a restaurant, choose "],[5453,"a meal, place the order and then "],[5459,"text the whole family with "],[5462,"what's for dinner and when it "],[5463,"will arrive. "],[5465,"That's combining the power of "],[5466,"your apps with Siri Shortcuts to "],[5469,"make everyday tasks really easy.\n\n"],[5473,"And of course -- "],[5479,"And of course Shortcuts work "],[5480,"across iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch "],[5483,"and HomePod too. "],[5485,"And that's our update for Siri.\n\n"],[5495,"Now I'd like to invite Jeff to tell you about the latest "],[5496,"advances in augmented reality. "],[5498,"Thank you.\n\n"],[5503,"Thanks, Bill. I am thrilled to be here today "],[5504,"to talk about augmented reality.\n\n"],[5507,"AR helps you visualize things "],[5509,"that are difficult, expensive or "],[5511,"impossible to do otherwise. "],[5513,"And since introducing ARKit, "],[5515,"we've seen amazing growth in "],[5518,"applications. "],[5519,"One may think of AR as only for "],[5522,"entertainment, but we've seen "],[5524,"great applications in education, "],[5526,"enterprise, commerce and more.\n\n"],[5531,"Commerce is a particularly "],[5533,"impressive use case with Home "],[5535,"Depot, Target and Wayfair all "],[5537,"having tens of thousands of "],[5539,"products available to preview in "],[5541,"AR. ARKit hosts the USDZ file "],[5546,"format and Quick Look together, "],[5549,"make the world's first mass "],[5551,"market augmented reality "],[5553,"commerce solution. "],[5554,"In fact, Wayfair is seeing more "],[5557,"than a threefold increase in "],[5559,"purchasing when folks view their "],[5561,"products in augmented reality.\n\n"],[5565,"And we love that this is a real "],[5566,"business use case. "],[5567,"This is a great real business "],[5568,"use case for augmented reality "],[5570,"in commerce.\n\n"],[5572,"We'd like to continue this "],[5573,"momentum by announcing that "],[5575,"Apple Pay will be integrated "],[5576,"directly with AR Quick Look this "],[5578,"fall. "],[5579,"This makes it easier for "],[5580,"consumers to try on and buy "],[5584,"items like these glasses, "],[5585,"directly from augmented reality. "],[5587,"ARKit for iOS and iPadOS are "],[5592,"the world's largest augmented "],[5596,"reality platform with hundreds "],[5598,"of millions of enabled devices. "],[5601,"And we've heard from many "],[5602,"developers, they love to take "],[5604,"advantage of this great "],[5605,"opportunity but may not be sure "],[5607,"where to start. "],[5608,"Or 3D can be a little bit "],[5609,"intimidating if you've never "],[5611,"used it before. Well, we've been listening and "],[5613,"we're really excited to announce "],[5616,"three technologies that make it "],[5618,"much easier to develop augmented "],[5620,"reality applications.\n\n"],[5622,"ARKit, RealityKit and Reality "],[5625,"Composer together provide the "],[5628,"frameworks and tools you need to "],[5630,"quickly and easily develop "],[5631,"augmented reality applications "],[5635,"and experiences. "],[5637,"Starting with Reality Composer, "],[5639,"you can create compelling AR "],[5640,"experiences even if you've never "],[5642,"worked with 3D before. "],[5643,"It provides an intuitive, what "],[5645,"you see is what you get "],[5646,"interface that integrates "],[5649,"seamlessly with Xcode.\n\n"],[5652,"And to show you Reality "],[5653,"Composer, I'd like to invite one "],[5654,"of my colleagues, Shrudi, up to "],[5656,"the stage.\n\n"],[5663,"Thank you, Jeff. "],[5664,"Happy to be here. "],[5665,"I have this great travel app "],[5667,"which shows some activities "],[5669,"offered on the main island of "],[5670,"Hawaii. "],[5671,"If the user opts for helicopter "],[5673,"tours, the app shows the path of "],[5676,"the helicopter. "],[5677,"How about we use AR to provide "],[5680,"users a better sense of the "],[5681,"actual tour? "],[5682,"I can do that by adding a button "],[5684,"to the existing app to launch my "],[5686,"AR experience. "],[5687,"Let's see how to do that. "],[5689,"First, we create a button using "],[5692,"SwiftUI.\n\n"],[5693,"Followed by adding that button "],[5695,"to my existing view. "],[5698,"Then I open an empty project "],[5699,"file in Reality Composer and "],[5701,"integrate it to my Xcode project "],[5703,"by simply dragging and dropping "],[5705,"it in Xcode. "],[5706,"To load my AR scene from this "],[5709,"Reality Composer project file, I "],[5712,"import RealityKit and then "],[5714,"create a new view for AR. "],[5718,"Oops. Sorry. "],[5719,"Create a new view for AR using "],[5721,"SwiftUI. "],[5722,"And that's all the code you need "],[5726,"to add an AR experience to your "],[5731,"existing app. Moving on to the fun part of "],[5733,"creating my AR scene with "],[5734,"Reality Composer. "],[5736,"I open my empty Reality project "],[5738,"and start by loading a custom "],[5740,"USTZ of the Hawaii model.\n\n"],[5747,"Sweet. Next I'd like to mark the "],[5749,"beginning of my helicopter tour. "],[5751,"For that I can use Reality "],[5753,"Composer's built-in content "],[5754,"library which offers hundreds of "],[5757,"professional-grade 3D content to "],[5758,"developers. "],[5759,"I'll use a simple sphere.\n\n"],[5768,"I can change the content's look, "],[5769,"by applying a different material "],[5771,"to it.\n\n"],[5774,"As you can see, placing content "],[5776,"in 3D is pretty simple and "],[5778,"intuitive with Reality Composer.\n\n"],[5781,"Let's see what else we can do "],[5784,"here. How about adding a cool fading "],[5785,"effect to the scene when the "],[5786,"scene starts. "],[5787,"I can do that by opening the "],[5789,"Behaviors panel and creating a "],[5791,"custom behavior which gets "],[5794,"triggered when the scene starts. "],[5795,"I first add an action to hide "],[5799,"all the content in the scene. "],[5801,"Then the scene starts, and then "],[5805,"add another action to make all "],[5807,"the content appear after a "],[5809,"certain duration. "],[5810,"How about we preview it right "],[5812,"here? "],[5813,"Awesome. Developing AR on Mac is "],[5818,"convenient, but it poses the "],[5821,"challenge of guessing the "],[5822,"content scale and look when "],[5825,"placed in real world. "],[5826,"That's why we created Reality "],[5828,"Composer for macOS as well as "],[5831,"iPadOS and iOS to remove the "],[5833,"guesswork out of development. "],[5834,"So I'll hand this off to Jeff to "],[5837,"see what we have so far on an "],[5838,"iPad.\n\n"],[5840,"Thanks very much, Shrudi. "],[5842,"So this is Reality Composer for "],[5845,"the iPad.\n\n"],[5847,"It has the same great features "],[5849,"that you see in the Reality "],[5850,"Composer for the Mac. "],[5851,"And we can take the seen that "],[5852,"Shrudi handed off and finish it "],[5853,"out with our final artwork. "],[5855,"So we've had someone create with "],[5857,"Adobe Arrow our final file or "],[5859,"our final artwork, and we'll put "],[5861,"it into the scene. So I'm going to take the proxy "],[5863,"art that Shrudi had. I'm going to replace that with "],[5866,"our new artwork. Let me check to see if that's "],[5868,"the right thing. Fantastic. "],[5869,"That is our final helicopter. "],[5871,"And I also want to bring in the "],[5872,"animation that goes with that. "],[5874,"That's super easy. "],[5875,"If you remember, she created "],[5876,"that behavior, so we're going to "],[5877,"look at that behavior and all "],[5878,"we're going to do is add an "],[5879,"additional action.\n\n"],[5883,"So we look for USDZ animation "],[5885,"which is bringing in the "],[5886,"animation that went with the "],[5887,"file.\n\n"],[5888,"Fantastic. "],[5889,"Looks good. "],[5890,"Let's preview that. "],[5892,"Great. So hide our Behaviors "],[5895,"tab. "],[5896,"That looks like what we want.\n\n"],[5899,"Perfect. Let's preview this in "],[5900,"AR, but you can do it with the "],[5902,"iPad.\n\n"],[5905,"Wow. Let's try that again.\n\n"],[5914,"Fantastic. That's exactly what I wanted it "],[5915,"to look like. "],[5916,"And we can also play that.\n\n"],[5919,"Perfect. We have the animation "],[5920,"of the helicopter touring the "],[5922,"island. That will look great in our "],[5923,"travel application.\n\n"],[5929,"So that's Reality Composer for "],[5930,"the iPad.\n\n"],[5931,"And you're going to love how you "],[5933,"can have the same great ease of "],[5935,"use and seamless experience "],[5937,"between macOS, iPadOS and iOS "],[5939,"with Reality Composer.\n\n"],[5949,"Now RealityKit. "],[5950,"RealityKit is a modern "],[5951,"high-performance 3D engine "],[5952,"designed from the ground up for "],[5955,"augmented reality rendering and "],[5956,"simulation. "],[5958,"And because it's delivered as a "],[5959,"framework, it's very easy for "],[5960,"all of you to take your 2D apps "],[5962,"and extend them into 3D.\n\n"],[5965,"RealityKit uses modern "],[5966,"visibly-based rendering and "],[5968,"materials. "],[5969,"It is a data-driven rendering "],[5970,"system and a fully "],[5971,"multi-threaded renderer that's "],[5975,"highly optimized for Apple's "],[5977,"GPUs.\n\n"],[5979,"And also, really importantly, "],[5981,"we've integrated ARKit scene "],[5983,"understanding into RealityKit. "],[5985,"Which means as ARKit leans more "],[5988,"about the environment, it "],[5989,"synchronizes this to your "],[5990,"virtual scene automatically. "],[5992,"We saw RealityKit in action this "],[5995,"morning. "],[5997,"Let's take a closer look.\n\n"],[5999,"Let's see what's really going "],[6000,"on.\n\n"],[6001,"The reality you see is based on "],[6003,"things like image-based "],[6005,"lighting, motion blur and camera "],[6007,"effects like depth of field and "],[6009,"camera noise that really blur "],[6011,"the line between what is reality "],[6013,"and what is virtual. "],[6014,"And you get these features with "],[6015,"RealityKit automatically.\n\n"],[6020,"You access RealityKit through a "],[6021,"new framework which is a native "],[6022,"Swift API. "],[6023,"It takes many advantages of the "],[6025,"key features of Swift to allow "],[6026,"you to write clear, compact "],[6028,"code.\n\n"],[6030,"Concepts Log and Rally are "],[6031,"directly integrated. "],[6033,"For example, it's easy to load "],[6035,"your AR assets and directly "],[6038,"attach them to anchors. "],[6040,"Protocol extensions provide easy "],[6043,"access to entity property which "],[6044,"allow you to quickly access "],[6046,"components such as lights or "],[6048,"shadows in this case and reduce "],[6050,"the need for runtime checks.\n\n"],[6053,"This also means that you're able "],[6054,"to work with entities in a "],[6055,"strongly-typed manner. "],[6057,"Here we're applying an angular "],[6058,"force to an entity that "],[6060,"participates in physics. And that's all the code you need "],[6063,"for this scene.\n\n"],[6068,"Last but definitely not least "],[6069,"today is a new version of our "],[6071,"augmented reality framework AR "],[6073,"Kit 3.\n\n"],[6075,"We've taken the most capable AR "],[6077,"platform in the world and made "],[6078,"it even more powerful with new "],[6080,"in-depth reverse features.\n\n"],[6084,"Since introducing ARKit, we've "],[6086,"had many developers ask to be "],[6087,"able to use the front and back "],[6088,"cameras simultaneously. "],[6090,"Well, in ARKit 3 you can. "],[6092,"So you can -- that's right, both "],[6094,"cameras at the same time.\n\n"],[6098,"This allows you to use face "],[6099,"tracking to drive your augmented "],[6101,"reality experiences directly.\n\n"],[6104,"And as Craig talked about this "],[6105,"morning, properly occluding "],[6107,"people in an AR scene is an "],[6109,"extremely tough problem. "],[6111,"You see it every time someone "],[6112,"walks in front of a virtual "],[6113,"object.\n\n"],[6115,"To solve this, we've built an "],[6116,"advanced machine-learning "],[6117,"algorithm that figures out which "],[6119,"pixels are a person, the depth "],[6121,"of that person in the scene and "],[6123,"uses its information to allow us "],[6125,"to properly render the scene in "],[6127,"the virtual objects. "],[6129,"With people occlusion, entirely "],[6130,"new experiences like Minecraft "],[6132,"Earth Demo you saw this morning "],[6133,"are possible.\n\n"],[6141,"Absolutely amazing. "],[6142,"And finally, we built a system "],[6143,"that allows humans to interact "],[6145,"with virtual content. "],[6147,"ARKit 3 is able to capture a "],[6148,"person's motion in real time "],[6151,"with just the single RGB camera "],[6153,"in an iPad or iPhone. "],[6155,"We again use a machine learned "],[6157,"algorithm to track the person, "],[6159,"building a 2D stick figure and "],[6162,"take that figure and then infer "],[6164,"a 3D motion from them or lift it "],[6167,"into 3D. "],[6169,"Both the 2D skeleton and the 3D "],[6170,"skeleton are available to "],[6171,"developers. "],[6172,"The 3D has over 90 articulated "],[6174,"joints and provides the same "],[6175,"ease of use as Face Kit.\n\n"],[6181,"So those are our new technologies. "],[6182,"ARKit 3, RealityKit, and "],[6185,"Reality Composer are tools and "],[6188,"frameworks that make it easy for "],[6190,"anyone, anyone, to build amazing "],[6194,"AR experiences. "],[6195,"And we'd like to do something "],[6198,"fun today, so we have a fun new "],[6199,"application at the conference. "],[6201,"You may have seen it, "],[6202,"SwiftStrike. "],[6203,"We're making a tabletop version "],[6205,"of this as a developer sample "],[6206,"available today. "],[6207,"It uses RealityKit, ARKit 3 and "],[6210,"Reality Composer and provides a "],[6212,"great starting point for your "],[6213,"applications.\n\n"],[6219,"Lots of fun.\n\n"],[6224,"Thank you.\n\n"],[6228,"And of course Metal powers a lot "],[6229,"of what we do in AR on our "],[6231,"devices. And to tell you more about "],[6232,"what's new in Metal, I'd like to "],[6234,"welcome Jeremy to the stage.\n\n"],[6239,"Thank you, Jeff. "],[6242,"So Metal is Apple's modern "],[6244,"high-performance GPU programming "],[6246,"API for graphics and compute. "],[6248,"It's also incredibly easy to "],[6249,"use, both for beginners and "],[6251,"experts alike. "],[6252,"And it brings stunning "],[6254,"performance increases, "],[6255,"supporting up to 100 times more "],[6257,"draw calls than OpenGL and "],[6258,"enabling a whole new generation "],[6260,"of advanced graphics "],[6261,"performance.\n\n"],[6263,"This is because Metal gives your "],[6265,"app direct control over the GPUs "],[6267,"that are at the core of Apple's "],[6269,"products. "],[6270,"And those GPUs now power over "],[6273,"1.4 billion Metal-capable system "],[6276,"from iPhones to iPads to the "],[6278,"all-new Mac Pro. "],[6280,"In fact, all of Apple's "],[6281,"platforms now run on Metal. "],[6283,"From our smooth user interface "],[6285,"to the latest 3D rendering in "],[6287,"RealityKit, to our advanced "],[6288,"camera processing pipeline, "],[6290,"we're using Metal everywhere. "],[6292,"And you can too. "],[6293,"To help you do just that, this "],[6296,"year we focused on three key "],[6297,"areas. "],[6298,"We've made Metal even easier to "],[6299,"use. "],[6300,"We've enabled all-new levels of "],[6302,"high-performance GPU compute. "],[6305,"And we've enhanced Metal for our "],[6307,"most demanding pro app "],[6308,"developers and customers. "],[6310,"First, with Metal's incredibly "],[6313,"approachable API and GPU shading "],[6315,"language, you can get started "],[6317,"with our powerful suite of "],[6318,"developer tools for GPU "],[6319,"debugging, profiling and "],[6321,"performance optimizing. "],[6323,"And we've made those tools even "],[6325,"better. "],[6326,"We have added full Metal support "],[6328,"to the iOS Simulator in Xcode.\n\n"],[6333,"We're glad you're excited about "],[6334,"it. We're really excited about it "],[6335,"too. You can now use Metal directly "],[6337,"in the simulator and you "],[6338,"automatically get major "],[6339,"performance improvements when "],[6341,"using UI Kits, Maps and all of "],[6343,"those system frameworks built on "],[6345,"Metal. And this is because the iOS "],[6346,"Simulator is now using the "],[6348,"native Metal support built right "],[6350,"into your Mac.\n\n"],[6352,"We've also added an all-new "],[6353,"Metal memory debugger. "],[6355,"You can now identify exactly how "],[6356,"much memory your app is using "],[6358,"for Metal textures, buffers and "],[6360,"heats and you can optimize your "],[6362,"games and apps to use every last "],[6364,"byte for even more advanced "],[6365,"graphics.\n\n"],[6367,"Now over the past few years, "],[6369,"Metal has grown to support the "],[6370,"advanced features of dozens of "],[6372,"GPUs, each with their own "],[6373,"hardware from every major GPU "],[6375,"vendor and across all of our "],[6377,"platforms and OS releases. "],[6379,"And as a developer you "],[6380,"previously had to manage all of "],[6381,"this complexity of these "],[6382,"different hardware feature sets "],[6384,"yourself.\n\n"],[6386,"Well this year we've made it much simpler with just three "],[6388,"Metal GPU families. "],[6390,"A Metal common GPU family, "],[6391,"identifying the vast majority of "],[6393,"Metal features that you can use "],[6394,"across all of our platforms. "],[6396,"A second family for the advanced "],[6398,"unique features of our Apple "],[6400,"Design GPUs and our iOS, iPadOS "],[6403,"and tvOS products. "],[6404,"And a third family for the "],[6407,"powerful GPUs on our Mac "],[6408,"systems. "],[6410,"And it makes it that much easier "],[6411,"to bring your apps from iOS to "],[6414,"macOS or the other way around.\n\n"],[6417,"Now, in addition to enabling "],[6419,"immersive games and advanced "],[6420,"graphics, Metal also gives your "],[6422,"app the ability to harness the "],[6423,"GPU for compute. "],[6425,"So what is GPU compute? "],[6428,"Well, GPUs were originally "],[6429,"designed to process large "],[6430,"numbers of pixels requiring the "],[6432,"execution of complex "],[6433,"mathematical computations in a "],[6435,"massively parallel fashion. "],[6436,"And it turns out we can apply "],[6438,"that computational horsepower to "],[6440,"a wide variety of tasks besides "],[6442,"traditional graphics. "],[6444,"So Metal provides all of the "],[6445,"building blocks that you need "],[6447,"for general purpose computation "],[6448,"on the GPU. "],[6450,"A familiar C++ based GPU "],[6452,"programming language, compute "],[6454,"command encoding, API and "],[6455,"runtime, a full-feature compiler "],[6458,"and debugger and a rich library "],[6460,"of shaders and kernels called "],[6461,"the Metal performance shaders.\n\n"],[6464,"This MPS library provides you "],[6465,"valuable compute functions all "],[6468,"pre-optimized for all of those "],[6470,"GPUs and all of those Apple "],[6471,"systems and it's all fully "],[6472,"integrated right into your Metal "],[6474,"code.\n\n"],[6476,"And on our Apple Design GPUs, "],[6478,"Metal also provides advanced "],[6479,"compute features like tile "],[6481,"shading, enabling you to combine "],[6482,"your compute shaders and your "],[6484,"fragment processing into one "],[6485,"simple, highly-efficient render "],[6488,"pass.\n\n"],[6489,"And this year we're also "],[6492,"introducing Metal indirect "],[6493,"compute command encoding. "],[6494,"It allows you to build your GPU "],[6496,"compute commands right on the "],[6497,"GPU itself, unlocking all-new "],[6499,"algorithms for compute "],[6500,"efficiency and freeing the CPU "],[6502,"for other activities in your "],[6504,"app. "],[6505,"And with the Radeon Pro Vega II, "],[6507,"the new Mac Pro is a GPU compute "],[6510,"monster, capable of up to 56 "],[6513,"teraflops of GPU compute all "],[6515,"made available to you via Metal. "],[6518,"Now that's a heck of a lot of "],[6519,"flops. I mean, look at them all. "],[6521,"They barely fit on the screen.\n\n"],[6525,"That's a lot.\n\n"],[6527,"So what can you do with all of "],[6529,"those flops of GPU compute? "],[6531,"Well, with Metal you can use "],[6532,"them for advanced compute "],[6533,"processing. "],[6534,"For your videos, you can improve "],[6535,"the quality of your photos. "],[6537,"You can train your ML models and "],[6539,"you can use them to accelerate "],[6541,"interactive ray tracing.\n\n"],[6544,"So we have further improved "],[6545,"Metal support for ray tracing "],[6546,"this year, now enabling dynamic "],[6548,"scenes by moving the bounding "],[6550,"volume hierarchy construction "],[6551,"from the CPU to the GPU, and "],[6553,"added all-new optimized MPS "],[6555,"de-noising filters to further "],[6557,"improve image quality. "],[6558,"Now ray tracing, it uses the GPU "],[6561,"to computationally model the "],[6563,"physical properties of lights "],[6565,"and surfaces and reflections and "],[6567,"it can be so complex, people "],[6568,"actually earn PhD's in this "],[6570,"topic. "],[6571,"So to show you how you can use "],[6572,"Metal and GPU Compute for ray "],[6575,"tracing, we decided to put "],[6576,"together a pretty simple "],[6577,"example. "],[6578,"And I'd now like to invite Rav "],[6579,"to the stage to give you a quick "],[6581,"demonstration. "],[6582,"Rav? "],[6589,"Thank you, Jeremy.\n\n"],[6591,"So we built a prototype hybrid "],[6593,"ray tracing engine to see what "],[6594,"we could do with Metal Compute "],[6596,"on the powerful new Mac Pro.\n\n"],[6600,"Now this toy city that we built "],[6603,"looks simple, but we're using "],[6604,"Metal to process over 1 billion "],[6606,"rays per second at 4K "],[6608,"resolution. "],[6610,"Let me walk you through what "],[6611,"we're doing here.\n\n"],[6613,"So we start by using Metal draw "],[6615,"commands to render the geometry "],[6617,"and material information that "],[6618,"we're going to use later, and "],[6621,"then switch to using Metal "],[6623,"Compute and the MPS ray triangle "],[6625,"intersection APIs to do all the "],[6628,"heavy lifting. "],[6629,"This includes calculating "],[6630,"ambient light at every surface "],[6632,"point, as you can see in this "],[6633,"image. "],[6634,"But also to simulate light "],[6636,"bouncing between objects in our "],[6637,"scene at increasing ray depth to "],[6640,"generate shadows, reflections "],[6644,"and even reflections within "],[6646,"those reflections. "],[6648,"And then we end by using the "],[6649,"optimized MPS or optimize "],[6651,"compute kernels in the new MPS "],[6653,"de-noiser to produce this really "],[6656,"high-quality image.\n\n"],[6658,"So traditional CPU renderers "],[6661,"would take over a minute to "],[6662,"generate a frame like this. "],[6664,"With Metal, we've been able to "],[6666,"reduce this to under 30 "],[6667,"milliseconds, which is a "],[6669,"staggering 1,000 times faster.\n\n"],[6673,"So pro app developers -- thank "],[6675,"you. We think it's pretty great too.\n\n"],[6681,"So pro app developers can now "],[6683,"use Metal Compute to build new "],[6685,"interactive tools to visualize "],[6687,"these physically accurate "],[6689,"lighting effects like these "],[6690,"dramatic shadows that are cast "],[6693,"by the buildings and also by "],[6696,"that fire escape.\n\n"],[6701,"Or if we pan over here to this "],[6702,"roof, the realistic way that "],[6705,"green light bounces onto this "],[6707,"neighboring building.\n\n"],[6710,"That just looks great. "],[6711,"Thank you.\n\n"],[6717,"Another great effect that we can "],[6718,"simulate or model is accurate "],[6720,"reflections, as you can see in "],[6722,"the windshields of this bus. "],[6724,"In fact, you can see the shadows "],[6726,"moving in that windshield or in "],[6727,"those reflections as I change "],[6729,"the position of the sun. "],[6730,"So that looks great, but "],[6734,"animating objects in a ray trace "],[6736,"scene can be very "],[6737,"computationally expensive "],[6739,"because we have to update the "],[6740,"bounding volume hierarchy that's "],[6742,"associated with the geometry.\n\n"],[6745,"Fortunately, with Metal Compute "],[6747,"and the MPS APIs, we're able to "],[6749,"move all of this work onto the "],[6752,"GPUs and achieve this great "],[6753,"animation.\n\n"],[6755,"And there go our trains. "],[6757,"So that was just an example of "],[6760,"what's possible when you use "],[6762,"Metal Compute for accelerated "],[6764,"ray tracing on the new Mac Pro. "],[6766,"It's a beast. "],[6767,"Thank you. "],[6768,"Back to you, Jeremy.\n\n"],[6773,"Thank you, Rav. "],[6774,"So that's what we did in just a "],[6776,"short bit of time. "],[6777,"But high-performance ray tracing "],[6779,"can be even more powerful in the "],[6780,"hands of our most expert "],[6782,"third-party developers. "],[6783,"Which is why we are so excited "],[6785,"that OTOY has announced they're "],[6787,"using Metal Compute to build "],[6789,"OctaneX, an all-new version of "],[6791,"Octane Renderer, their "],[6792,"interactive path tracing engine "],[6794,"optimized for Metal and the "],[6796,"Apple platforms.\n\n"],[6798,"And we are incredibly thrilled "],[6800,"to be working with Maxon who's "],[6801,"bringing their powerful "],[6802,"GPU-accelerated renderer "],[6804,"Redshift to the Mac with an "],[6806,"all-new version optimized for "],[6808,"Metal and the new Mac Pro. "],[6810,"So with advanced Metal Compute "],[6813,"APIs and incredibly powerful "],[6814,"hardware, we've built Metal to "],[6817,"power the most advanced "],[6818,"professional content creation "],[6820,"tools. "],[6821,"And we've been working really "],[6822,"closely with the leading app "],[6823,"developers who have all "],[6825,"announced that the upcoming "],[6826,"versions of these professional "],[6828,"content creation tools and apps "],[6830,"will be fully optimized for "],[6831,"Metal and the Apple platforms.\n\n"],[6835,"For instance, Serif has just "],[6837,"announced an all-new version of "],[6838,"Affinity Photo for Mac using "],[6840,"Metal's graphics and Compute "],[6842,"APIs to hypercharge their "],[6844,"advanced photo processing engine "],[6846,"in achieving stunning "],[6848,"performance increases. "],[6849,"More than 10 times better "],[6850,"performance and jaw-dropping "],[6852,"increases of 50 times better "],[6854,"performance using Metal with "],[6856,"multiple GPUs on the new Mac "],[6858,"Pro.\n\n"],[6860,"So to enable these kinds of pro "],[6861,"apps and this kind of "],[6862,"performance, we work really "],[6863,"closely with our GPU hardware "],[6865,"and software partner teams to "],[6866,"add all-new features to Metal. "],[6868,"To support the new AMD Infinity "],[6870,"Fabric link in the new Mac Pro, "],[6872,"we added the Metal Peer Group "],[6873,"API. "],[6875,"So what does this do? "],[6876,"Well, previously sharing "],[6877,"workloads across multiple GPUs "],[6880,"would require moving large "],[6881,"amounts of data in a round trip "],[6883,"across the PCI bus. "],[6884,"But with the Metal Peer Group "],[6886,"API, apps can use multiple GPUs "],[6889,"much more efficiently, directly "],[6891,"sharing data across the Infinity "],[6892,"Fabric link and without taking "],[6894,"that long and scenic route "],[6896,"through system memory.\n\n"],[6898,"Now finally, you've seen how you "],[6900,"can use Metal Compute and the "],[6902,"new Mac Pro to process a whole "],[6905,"lot more pixels. "],[6906,"But we also want you to produce "],[6909,"even more beautiful pixels. "],[6910,"So we've introduced the gorgeous "],[6912,"new Pro Display XDR with all-new "],[6915,"HDR software support in macOS. "],[6918,"You can now use the AV "],[6919,"Foundation APIs to decode HDR "],[6921,"videos or you can render native "],[6924,"HDR content directly with Metal. "],[6926,"You can manage the HDR display "],[6928,"tone mapping yourself or you can "],[6929,"let the window system and our "],[6931,"advanced display system software "],[6933,"handle it all for you. "],[6934,"And with these same APIs, you "],[6937,"can also access a far greater "],[6938,"range of brightness levels on "],[6940,"many of our existing Mac "],[6941,"displays as well. "],[6943,"So that's our Metal update for "],[6945,"today. It's even easier to use Metal "],[6947,"across all of our platforms with "],[6948,"Metal in the iOS Simulator and "],[6950,"simplified GPU families. "],[6952,"We have all-new features and "],[6953,"powerful hardware to unleash "],[6955,"all-new levels of GPU compute "],[6957,"performance. "],[6958,"And we built Metal to be the "],[6959,"best GPU programming API to "],[6962,"drive modern professional "],[6963,"content creation tools and apps. "],[6966,"So thank you very much. "],[6967,"I'll hand it back to Sebastien "],[6968,"now. "],[6969,"Thank you.\n\n"],[6974,"Thank you, Jeremy. "],[6975,"Don't you love Metal? "],[6976,"Don't you love the power of "],[6977,"Metal? "],[6978,"Really, really amazing. "],[6980,"Now what you've seen this "],[6981,"afternoon is a huge amount of "],[6983,"new technology that's new for "],[6985,"all of you as developers. "],[6987,"And what we've shown covering "],[6988,"developer tools, the Apple "],[6990,"platforms and core technologies "],[6992,"is just some of the highlights. "],[6994,"We actually have so much more to "],[6996,"show you this week. "],[6997,"And so ahead of us are 109 "],[6999,"different sessions. "],[7000,"And it turns out that that "],[7002,"wasn't enough to cover "],[7003,"everything. "],[7004,"So this year we added an "],[7005,"additional 27 video-only "],[7008,"sessions.\n\n"],[7010,"And when you want to dive even "],[7011,"deeper, you could sit down with "],[7013,"some of the over 1,000 Apple "],[7015,"engineers that are here at WWDC "],[7016,"in 229 different lab sessions "],[7020,"throughout the week.\n\n"],[7023,"So get out there and prepare to "],[7025,"have your minds blown. "],[7026,"It's going to be a great week. "]]}}
